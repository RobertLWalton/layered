\section{Introduction}

This document describes the Lower Layer Programming Language, or
L-Language.  See the Introduction to the Layered
Programming Languages for basic syntax and for an overview of the related
Middle Layer M-Language and Higher Layer H-Language (these overviews
have not yet been written).

The L-Language is intended to be a target language for compilers of
higher level languages.  As such it is optimized first to be an easy to 
use as a target language, and second to be easy to
compile into reasonably efficient debuggable assembly language code.

The L-Language is similar to the C programming language
differs in the following ways:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
L-Language facilitates isolating non-type-safe code into small inline functions.

\item
All L-Language data types are builtin number types or subtypes of
builtin number types.  All data managed directly by L-Language consists
of single numbers allocated to the stack.

Other memory is handled by code
encapsulated in small non-type-safe inline functions by the programmer.
Memory references other than those to single stack allocated numbers
are treated in a manner reminiscent of input/output.

\item
The type `\TT{type}' is first class, is a subtype of integers, and
is assigned a unique constant small integer value for each type.  Constant
argument values, such as the value of a `\TT{type}' valued
argument, can be used to select overloaded functions.

\item
Most L-Language functions are inline.  Out-of-line functions can be
called using a block syntax that mirrors the overhead involved in
manipulating an argument stack in memory.

\item
L-Language uses a single-assignment style of program structure
to encourage
efficient code that leaves an audit trail for debugging in the stack.
Partial evaluation of expressions and inline code is supported without
compromising debuggability.

\item
L-Language allows code to be compiled at run-time just before
it is run, for extra efficiency.

\item
L-Language allows code to be compiled into the compiler, to support
language enhancements.

\item
L-Language uses the Layered Language Module Structure to manage
multi-file source code in a well-ordered and type-safe manner.


\end{enumerate}


\section{Types}
\label{TYPES}

The basic builtin types are the number types and the \TT{void} type.
All defined types are subtypes of these types.
One of the builtin defined subtypes is the `\TT{type}' type.

\subsection{Number Types}
\label{NUMBER-TYPES}

Numbers are sequences of bits, and each number is one of
four kinds, unsigned integer, signed integer, floating point number,
or address:

\begin{indpar}
\begin{tabular}{p{1in}@{~~~~~~}p{2in}@{~~~~~~}l}
\bf Name & \bf Kind & \bf Length \\[2ex]
\ttkey{uns8}		& unsigned integer & 8 bits \\
\ttkey{uns16}		& unsigned integer & 16 bits \\
\ttkey{uns32}		& unsigned integer & 32 bits \\
\ttkey{uns64}		& unsigned integer & 64 bits \\
\ttkey{uns128}		& unsigned integer & 128 bits
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{p{1in}@{~~~~~~}p{2in}@{~~~~~~}l}
\ttkey{int8}		& signed integer & 8 bits \\
\ttkey{int16}		& signed integer & 16 bits \\
\ttkey{int32}		& signed integer & 32 bits \\
\ttkey{int64}		& signed integer & 64 bits \\
\ttkey{int128}		& signed integer & 128 bits
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{p{1in}@{~~~~~~}p{2in}@{~~~~~~}l}
\ttkey{float16}		& IEEE floating point number & 16 bits \\
\ttkey{float32}		& IEEE floating point number & 32 bits \\
\ttkey{float64}		& IEEE floating point number & 64 bits \\
\ttkey{float128}	& IEEE floating point number & 128 bits
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{p{1in}@{~~~~~~}p{2in}@{~~~~~~}l}
\ttkey{unsadr}		& unsigned integer & size of address \\
\ttkey{intadr}		& signed integer & size of address \\
\ttkey{adr}		& signed or unsigned integer & size of address \\
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{p{1in}@{~~~~~~}p{2in}@{~~~~~~}l}
\ttkey{unswrd}		& unsigned integer & size of machine word \\
\ttkey{intwrd}		& signed integer & size of machine word \\
\end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

These are the \key{built in number types}:
\begin{indpar}
{\em builtin-number-type-name}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}cl}
    ::= & \TT{uns8} $|$ \TT{uns16} $|$ \TT{uns32} $|$ \TT{uns64}
                    $|$ \TT{uns128} \\
    $|$ & \TT{int8} $|$ \TT{int16} $|$ \TT{int32} $|$ \TT{int64}
                    $|$ \TT{int128} \\
    $|$ & \TT{float16} $|$ \TT{float32} $|$ \TT{float64} $|$ \TT{float128} \\
    $|$ & \TT{unsadr} $|$ \TT{intadr} $|$ \TT{adr}
                      $|$ \TT{unswrd} $|$ \TT{intwrd} \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

The \mkey{length}{of number}
of a number is the number of its bits.  Numbers can have
different lengths: for example, unsigned integers can have
lengths of 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128 bits.

Numbers are stored in registers or in random access memory (RAM).

An \key{unsigned integer} of length $L$ is a binary integer with
$L$ binary digits (\skey{bit}s) and range from $0$ to $2^L-1$.

A \key{signed integer} of length $L$ is a two's complement integer
of length $L$ and range from $-2^{L-1}$ to $+2^{L-1}-1$.
This represents the integer $I$ in the given range
by the unsigned $L$-bit integer equal to $I~\mbox{modulo}~2^L$.

A \key{floating point number} of length $L$ is a floating point number
represented according to the IEEE 754 standard.  The sizes of exponents
and mantissas for various floating point number sizes are as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l@{~~~~~~}l@{~~~~~~}l@{~~~~~~}r@{~~~~~~}r}
                   &              &              &             & \bf Maximum \\
\bf Floating Point & \bf Exponent & \bf Mantissa & \bf Decimal & \bf Decimal\\
\bf Number Size    & \bf Size     & \bf Size     & \bf Digits  & \bf Exponent
\\[2ex]
16 bits & 5 bits & 10 bits & 3.31 & 4.51 \\
32 bits & 8 bits & 23 bits & 7.22 & 38.23 \\
64 bits & 11 bits & 52 bits & 15.95 & 307.95 \\
128 bits & 15 bits & 112 bits & 34.02 & 4931.77 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

An \key{address} holds a RAM byte address.
An address is a 32-bit or 64-bit signed or unsigned integer whose size
and signage are determined by the target machine.
Some of high order bits may be
required to be all 0's or all 1's, depending upon
the target machine.  The \TT{unsadr} and \TT{intadr}
unsigned and signed integer types of the same size
as an address are provided for storing indices and offsets.

A reasonable assumption for 64-bit addresses is that only the low
order 48-bits of the address are actually used.  This assumption can
be used to put other information in the high order 16 bits
of a 64-bit number containing an address.  For example, an address
can be embedded in a 64-bit floating point NaN.  The L-Language does
\underline{not} depend upon this assumption, but does provide a builtin function
that takes as input a 64-bit integer and two small integers, $L$ and $S$,
and returns a 64-bit address containing
the byte address equal to the low order $L$ bits of the input integer
left shifted by $S$.  The output may have undefined high order bits if
the hardware ignores them when using the output to address memory.
For example, if the hardware ignores the high order 20 bits, and uses only the
low order 44 bits,
this function would just copy its input 64-bit integer to its output
if $L\geq 44$ and $S=0$.\footnote{The I86 64-bit architecture
uses only the low order 48 bits of an address, but \underline{requires}
the high order 17 bits to all be the same, either all 1's or all 0's.
However, as it is unlikely that there will ever be an allocated memory region
that includes address 0 in its interior, it makes no significant difference
whether we consider addresses to be unsigned or signed.}

The following \underline{implicit} conversion operators are defined:
\begin{center}

\begin{tabular}{r@{~}l}
\TT{uns}$x$ & \TT{(} \TT{uns}$y${\em -value} \TT{)} \\
\TT{int}$x$ & \TT{(} \TT{uns}$y${\em -value} \TT{)} \\
\TT{float}$x$ & \TT{(} \TT{uns}$y${\em -value} \TT{)} \\
\TT{int}$x$ & \TT{(} \TT{int}$y${\em -value} \TT{)} \\
\TT{float}$x$ & \TT{(} \TT{int}$y${\em -value} \TT{)} \\
\TT{float}$x$ & \TT{(} \TT{float}$y${\em -value} \TT{)} \\
\end{tabular}

where $x>y$

\end{center}

For all these implicit conversions no information is lost from
the value when it is converted to the new type.

The following \underline{unchecked}
conversion operator is defined provided $t2$ is known at compile time:
\begin{center}

\TT{*UNCHECKED*~}$t2$~~\TT{(} ~~ $t1${\em -value} ~~\TT{)}%
\label{<<**}

for any two builtin number types $t1$ and $t2$.

\end{center}

The \TT{*UNCHECKED*} conversion operator is defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The implicit conversion `$t2$ \TT{(} $t1${\em -value} \TT{)}'
if that is defined.
\item $t2$ is a floating point type,
and the $t1$-value is a number within the range of values representable
by a $t2$ value.
The result is the rounded $t1$-value,
where the method of rounding is indeterminate.
\item $t2$ is a floating point type,
and the $t1$-value is a number outside the range of values representable
by a $t2$ value.
The result is plus infinity, \TT{+Inf}, or minus infinity, \TT{-Inf},
according to the sign of the $t1$-value.
\item $t2$ is a floating point type,
and the $t1$-value is a floating point \TT{NaN}.
The result is a floating point \TT{NaN}, but precisely which \TT{NaN}
is undefined.
\item $t2$ and $t1$ are integer types and the $t1$-value is too large
to be represented as a $t2$ value.
The result is the $t2$ value that
equals modulo $2^n$ the {\em numeric-constant}, where $n$ is the
number of bits in a $t2$ value.
where $n$ is the length in bits of $t2$.
\item $t2$ is an integer type and $t1$ is a floating point type, and
the $t1$-value rounded toward zero to an integer
can be represented as a $t2$ value,
the result is this rounded $t1$-value.
\item $t2$ is an integer type and $t1$ is a floating point type,
the $t1$-value cannot be represented as a $t2$ value because its
absolute value is too large, or because it is not a number but is
\TT{+Inf}, \TT{-Inf}, or a \TT{NaN}.  The result is undefined, but
the floating point \key{invalid operation} flag is set.
\end{itemize}

Numeric constants are treated as if they had their own type,
\key{numeric-constant}.\footnote{Otherwise we would have problems
representing \TT{256}.  If we used \TT{uns16} we could not implicitly
convert to \TT{int16}, and if we used \TT{int16} we could not implicitly
convert to \TT{uns16}.}
The implicit conversion:
\begin{center}
$t2$ \TT{(} {\em numeric-constant} \TT{)}
\end{center}
is defined when $t2$ is known at compile time and either:
\begin{itemize}
\item No information about the size, sign, and
precision of the number is lost by representing the number
as a $t2$ type value.
\item $t2$ is a floating point type,
and the {\em numeric-constant} is within the range of values representable
by a $t2$ value.  The result is the {\em numeric-constant} rounded to
the nearest representable $t2$ value, where if there are two identically
nearest values, the one with a zero lowest order bit is chosen.
\end{itemize}

The \underline{unchecked} conversion:
\begin{center}
\TT{*UNCHECKED*} $t2$ \TT{(} {\em numeric-constant} \TT{)}
\end{center}
is defined if $t2$ is known at compile time
and one of the following cases applies:
\begin{itemize}
\item The implicit conversion `$t2$ \TT{(} {\em numeric-constant} \TT{)}'
if that is defined.
\item $t2$ is a floating point type,
and the {\em numeric-constant} is outside the range of values representable
by a $t2$ value.
The result is plus infinity, \TT{+Inf}, or minus infinity, \TT{-Inf},
according to the sign of the {\em numeric-constant}.
\item $t2$ is an integer type, the {\em numeric-constant}
has a fractional part, and
the {\em numeric-constant} rounded toward zero to an integer
can be represented as a $t2$ value,
the result is this rounded {\em numeric-constant}.
\item $t2$ is an integer type
and the {\em numeric-constant} is an integer
outside the range of values representable
by a $t2$ value.
The result is the $t2$ value that
equals modulo $2^n$ the {\em numeric-constant}, where $n$ is the
number of bits in a $t2$ value.
\item $t2$ is an integer type,
and the {\em numeric-constant} is floating point and
outside the range of values representable
by a $t2$ value.
A compile error is signalled.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Void Type}
\label{THE-VOID-TYPE}

A \ttkey{void} type variable has no value.  No value can be
assigned to such a variable.  Nevertheless such variables have
uses, for example, as base variable in clusters (\pagref{CLUSTERS}).
When used as the base variable of a cluster, an assignment statement
may appear to be assigning a value to a \TT{void} variable, but
in fact it is assigning values to cluster members.

\subsection{Defined Types}
\label{DEFINED-TYPES}

A declaration statement of the following form defines a type:
\begin{center}
\TT{type} {\em qualifier-name}\STAR{} {\em defined-type-name}
          \TT{is} {\em base-type-name}
\end{center}
Any {\em qualifiers} in the declaration are attached to every
variable or argument declared to have the defined type (see
section \itemref{QUALIFIERS} for more on this).

A value of a defined type may be converted to or from its base
type by the
\underline{unchecked}
operations:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r@{~}l}
\TT{*UNCHECKED*} {\em base-type-name}
	& \TT{(} {\em defined-type-value} \TT{)}\\
\TT{*UNCHECKED*} {\em defined-type-name}
	& \TT{(} {\em base-type-value} \TT{)}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
These operators do not change the actual value, but merely its
compile-time type.  Implied conversions in one direction only
may be defined as desired.


\subsection{Enumeration Values}
\label{Enumeration-VALUES}

An \key{enumeration type} is a defined type whose values are
integers assigned to \skey{enumeration constant}s.
Each enumeration constant is assigned a value during compilation
that is an integer unique relative to all enumeration
constants of its enumeration type that are being compiled together.
Then during linking the enumeration constant is assigned a possibly
different value that is an integer unique relative to all enumeration
constants of its enumeration type that are being linked together.

A declaration statement of the following form defines an \key{enumeration type}
that has enumeration values:
\begin{center}
\TT{type} {\em qualifier-name}\STAR{} {\em defined-enum-type-name}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{l}
    \TT{is}~~~{\em base-enum-type-name} \\
    \TT{with enum range}~~~{\em enum-range} \\
    \{ \TT{without implicit conversion} \}\QMARK
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
where
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rrl}
\emkey{base-enum-type-name}
    & ::= & {\em builtin-number-type-name} \\
    & $|$ & {\em enum-direction}~~~{\em defined-enum-type-name} \\
\emkey{enum-direction}
    & ::= & \TT{next} $|$ \TT{previous} \\
\emkey{enum-range}
    & ::= & \TT{[} {\em first-enum} \TT{..} {\em last-enum} \TT{]} \\
    & $|$ & \TT{[} {\em first-enum} \TT{..} \TT{]} \\
    & $|$ & \TT{[} \TT{..} {\em first-enum} \TT{]} \\
\emkey{first-enum}
    & ::= & {\em compile-time-integer-expression} \\
\emkey{last-enum}
    & ::= & {\em compile-time-integer-expression} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Here {\em first-enum} must be less than or equal to {\em last-enum}.
If {\em last-enum} is not given, it is assumed to be the maximum
value provided by the base enumeration type.
If {\em first-enum} is not given, it is assumed to be the minimum
value provided by the base enumeration type.

Enumeration values can be assigned by declaration statements of the form
\begin{indpar}
\emkey{enum-assignment}
    ::= {\em enum-type-name} {\em constant-name} \TT{is} \TT{next enum} \\
\emkey{enum-assignment}
    ::= {\em enum-type-name} {\em constant-name} \TT{is} \TT{previous enum}
\end{indpar}

Within a compilation the compiler assigns the value {\em first-enum}
to the first constant named in a `\TT{next enum}'
{\em enum-assignment} statement for
the given type, and then for subsequent such statements
assigns values in increasing order.
It is an error if `\TT{next~enum}'
would return a value beyond the {\em last-enum} value in a range.

Similarly the compiler assigns the value {\em last-enum}
to the first constant named in a `\TT{previous enum}'
{\em enum-assignment} statement for
the given type, and then for subsequent such statements
assigns values in decreasing order.
It is an error if `\TT{previous~enum}'
would return a value below the {\em first-enum} value in a range.

It is also an error if for a given type the same value is returned
by some \TT{next~enum} and also by some \TT{previous~enum}.

Within a linked load the process is the same, but the values assigned
to a constant may differ from those assigned during compilation,
so that all such assignments for a given type within a linked load
will be distinct.  The assignments occur when the code containing
the statements is linked, not when that code is executed.

Within a compilation module, all assignments to an enumeration type
are done in the same order during linking as during compilation.
Thus values assigned within the same module can be assumed to be
in the same order at compile and link times.  Also,
compile and link values
can be assumed to be the same if all values of the enumeration type
are assigned in the same compilation module.

When the {\em base-enum-type-name} names another enumeration type,
the {\em enum-range} given is mapped to a subrange of the
base enumeration type.  More specifically,
\begin{center}
\TT{type X is next Y with enum [m~...~n]}
\end{center}
allocates
the next \TT{n - m + 1} values of \TT{Y} as per `\TT{next enum}'
and maps them to the values
of \TT{X} beginning with \TT{m} and ending with \TT{n}.
If `\TT{next}' is replaced by `\TT{previous}', the action is the
same but the values of \TT{Y} are allocate as per `\TT{previous enum}'
and mapped to the values
of \TT{X} beginning with \TT{n} and ending with \TT{m}, so the order
of values of \TT{X} is always the same as their order when they
are viewed as values of \TT{Y}.

The conversions
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
{\em base-enum-type-name}
	& \TT{(} {\em defined-enum-type-value} \TT{)} \\
\TT{*UNCHECKED*} {\em base-enum-type-name}
	& \TT{(} {\em defined-enum-type-value} \TT{)} \\
\TT{*UNCHECKED*} {\em defined-enum-type-name}
	& \TT{(} {\em base-enum-type-value} \TT{)} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
may be used to convert between enumeration values and their base enumeration
values.
It is an error if the result of one of these conversions is outside
the range of the result enumeration type.

The implicit conversion is \underline{not} defined if the
`\TT{without implicit conversion}' option is given in the
enumeration type definition.

The \key{underlying type} of a type \TT{T} is \TT{T} itself if
\TT{T} is a builtin integer type or \TT{void}, and is the underlying
type of the base type of \TT{T} if \TT{T} is a defined type
(see \pagref{UNDERLYING-TYPE}).
Thus every enumeration type \TT{E} has an underlying integer
type \TT{I}.  Given these, the following are defined:

\begin{indpar}[0.5in]
\hspace*{-0.3in}{\tt (I i-value) = \ttkey{integer of}
			( E e-value )} \\
Returns the integer associated with the \TT{e-value} by the
`\TT{with enum range}' clause in the definition of \TT{E},
if \TT{E} is an enumeration type.  Returns the \TT{e-value}
itself if \TT{E} is a builtin integer type.
\end{indpar}

The value returned by this function may be different than
the value returned by implicit conversion of the \TT{e-value} to type \TT{I},
assuming the later is defined, i.e., that `\TT{without implicit conversion}'
clauses were omitted from the definitions.  If \TT{B} is the base
type of \TT{E}, then
\begin{center}
\TT{I(e-value) == I(B(e-value))} which may not equal \TT{integer of (e-value)}
\end{center}
This is exemplified by:
\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
type E1 is int32 with enum range [1 .. 20]
E1 C1 = previous enum
    // Now integer of (C1) == 20 == int32(C1)
type E2 is previous E1 with enum range [1 .. 10]
    // E2(1) ---> E1(19) and E2(10) ---> E1(9)
E2 C2 = next enum 
    // Now integer of (C2) == 1,
    // integer of ( E1(C2) ) == 19 = int32(C2)
type E3 is previous E2 with enum range [1 .. 5]
    // E3(1) ---> E2(10) ---> E1(9)
    // E3(5) ---> E2(6)  ---> E1(14)
E3 C3 = next enum 
    // Now integer of (C3) == 1,
    // integer of ( E2(C3) ) == 10,
    // integer of ( E1(E2(C3)) ) = 9 = int32(C3)
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

The following are uiltin enumeration types:
\begin{indpar}
\TT{type~type~is unswrd with enum [0~..]} \\
\TT{type~missing~is next enum // 0} \\
\TT{type~type~is next enum // 1}
\\[1ex]
\TT{type~qualifier~is unswrd with enum [0~..]} \\
\TT{qualifier~missing~is next enum // 0}
\\[1ex]
\TT{type~}\ttkey{bool}\TT{~is unswrd with enum [0~..~1]} \\
\TT{bool}~\ttkey{false}\TT{~is next enum // 0} \\
\TT{bool}~\ttkey{true}\TT{~~is next enum // 1}
\end{indpar}

Builtin types not mentioned above, such as `\TT{void}' and `\TT{int32}',
are given unspecified `\TT{type}' enumeration values.
Similarly builtin qualifiers, such as `\TT{mem}', are given
unspecified `\TT{quali\-fier}' enumeration values.  Conversions and
`\TT{integer of}' functions above
can be used to find the integer values of any
enumeration constant.

\subsection{Enumeration Sets}
\label{Enumeration-Sets}

An enumeration set is a set of enumeration values.  The syntax
for enumeration set constants is:
\begin{indpar}
\emkey{enum-set-constant}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}cl}
    ::= &\TT{\{\{~\}\}} \\
    $|$ &\TT{\{\{} {\em enum-set-item}
                   \{ \TT{,} {\em enum-set-item} \}\STAR{} \TT{\}\}} \\
    \end{tabular} \\
\emkey{enum-set-item}
    ::= {\em enum-value} $|$ {\em enum-range} \\
\emkey{enum-range}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}cl}
    ::= & {\em enum-value}~~~\TT{..}~~~{\em enum-value} \\
    $|$ & {\em enum-value}~~~\TT{..} \\
    $|$ & \TT{..}~~~{\em enum-value} \\
    \end{tabular} \\
\emkey{enum-value} ::= {\em compile-time-enum-expression}
\end{indpar}

If the {\em enum-values} in an {\em enum-set-constant} have different
enumeration types, implicit conversions from these to their base types
are inserted until all have the same defined enumeration type,
which is called the
`\key{common enumeration type}'\label{COMMON-ENUMERATION-TYPE}
of the set.
This is the most specific least general type to which all the set
values can be converted (see \pagref{CONVERSION-RELATION}).
It is an error
if this cannot be done because some of the types have no implicit
conversion defined for them, or if after implict conversion the
common type is not a defined enumeration type.
Importantly, note that the common type cannot be a builtin integer
type.

An {\em enum-range} designates the two values given and all
values in between.
After implict conversion, the first {\em enum-value} in an {\em enum-range}
must \underline{not} be greater than the second {\em enum-value}
in the {\em enum-range}.  If the first or second {\em enum-value} of
an {\em enum-range} is omitted, it is taken to be the lower or upper
limit of the enumeration type of the non-omitted {\em enum-value}.

The order in which values are given in an {\em enum-set-constant}
does not matter.  Overlapping and adjoining ranges are implictly
combined.\footnote{Internally an enumeration set may be stored as a
sorted list of integers with binary indicators specifying when all
the values between one integer and the next integer are to be included
in the set.}
Thus
\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
type X is uns8 with enum range [1 .. 20]
X X1 is next enum
X X2 is next enum
. . . . . . . . . .
X X20 is next enum

// Then:
//
//    {{ X1, X5, X2, X10 .. X16, X19 .. X20, X15 .. X18 }}
// == {{ X1, X2, X5, X10 .. X20 }}
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

Enumeration set values are used in logical expressions that
condition function lookup.  For example,
\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
T v = signed max ( type T, T v1, T v2 )
      [[ T in {{ int8, int16, int32, int64, int128 }} ]]:
    . . . . . . . . . . .
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

defines a function that takes only signed integer type
arguments, and not unsigned integer type arguments.
The logical expression inside \TT{[[~]]} must be satisfied
for the function definition to match a function call, and
the type argument \TT{T}, which is implicit and need not be
given in the function call, must be in the give set of
types, where types are values of the enumeration type `\TT{type}'
(see Section~\itemref{TYPE-VALUES}).

The following are builtin enumeration set types:
\begin{indpar}
\TT{type~}\ttkey{types}\TT{~is~}\ldots{} \\
\TT{type~}\ttkey{qualifiers}\TT{~is~}\ldots{}
\end{indpar}

The underlying type of all the elements of an enumeration set must be
the same, and this is the underlying type of the set.
If $x$ and $y$ are enumeration set types and $e$ is an enumeration value
and all have the same underlying type, then the following operations
are defined if the result exists:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace*{0.5in}}p{4.0in}}
$x$ \TT{+} $y$	& The union of $x$ and $y$. \\
$x$ \TT{*} $y$	& The intersection of $x$ and $y$. \\
$x$ \TT{-} $y$	& The set difference of $x$ minus $y$. \\
$e$ \TT{in} $x$	& \TT{true} if $e$ is in the set $x$,
                  and otherwise \TT{false}. \\
$e$ \TT{+} $x$	& The union of $\{e\}$ and $x$. \\
$x$ \TT{+} $e$	& Ditto. \\
$x$ \TT{-} $e$	& The set $x$ with $e$ deleted. \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Note that if the result is an enumeration set, it cannot exist
if it would have no common enumeration type:
see \pagref{COMMON-ENUMERATION-TYPE}.  If it result does not
exist, the operation producing it is in error.

\subsection{Type Values}
\label{TYPE-VALUES}

The type `\TT{type}' is a builtin enumeration type declared
by the builtin equivalent of:
\begin{indpar}
\TT{type~}\ttkey{type}\TT{~is unswrd with enum [0~..]} \\
\TT{type}~\ttkey{missing}\TT{~is next enum // 0} \\
\TT{type}~\ttkey{type}\TT{~is next enum // 1}
\end{indpar}
Each type is associated with a unique enumeration value
of type `\TT{type}', and this value can be used at both
compile and run time to test whether two `\TT{type}'s are
equal.

Values of one type \TT{T1} can be converted implicitly to another
type \TT{T2} if and only if an inline function with prototype:
\begin{center}
\TT{Q T2} {\em result-variable}%
    ~~\TT{=}~~\TT{( qualifiers Q, Q T1} {\em source-variable} \TT{)}
\end{center}
is defined.  In this case we say the \TT{T1} is \mkey{more specific}{types}
than \TT{T2}, or \TT{T2} is \mkey{more general}{types} than \TT{T1}, or
\begin{center}
\TT{T1~~>~~T2}
\end{center}%
\label{CONVERSION-RELATION}
The transitive closure of the \TT{>} relation between types is
required to be a partial order,
or equivalently, the directed graph
\begin{center}
\TT{T1 ---> T2} ~~~~~ if and only if ~~~~~ \TT{T1~~>~~T2}
\end{center}
is required to be acyclic.

Functions can be overloaded based on the number and types
of their arguments and also on the values of arguments that
are known at compile time.  Thus different functions with
the common prototype
\begin{center}
\TT{(unsadr length) = size of ( type T )}
\end{center}
may be defined for different values of \TT{T}.  
This is done automatically for the following functions:

\begin{indpar}[0.5in]
\hspace*{-0.3in}{\tt (type B) = \ttkey{base type of}
			( type T )} \\
Returns the base type \TT{B} of the type \TT{T}.  For defined
types this is the associated builtin type.  For builtin types, it is
\TT{T} itself.

\hspace*{-0.3in}{\tt (type U) = \ttkey{underlying type of}
			( type T )}\label{UNDERLYING-TYPE} \\
Returns \TT{T} if \TT{T} is a builtin integer type or \TT{void}.
Otherwise returns 
\begin{center}
\TT{underlying type of ( base type of ( T ) )}
\end{center}

\hspace*{-0.3in}{\tt (unsadr size) = \ttkey{size of}
			( type T )} \\
Returns \TT{size}, the number of bytes in a value of type \TT{T}.
For defined types it is the size of their underlying type
(the size of \TT{void} is \TT{0}).

\hspace*{-0.3in}{\tt (unsadr alignment) = \ttkey{alignment of}
			( type T )} \\
Returns \TT{alignment}, a strictly positive integer.
The address of a value of type \TT{T} in RAM should
optimally be a multiple of the \TT{alignment}.
The alignment of builtin types is their size.
For defined types it is the alignment of their underlying type.

\hspace*{-0.3in}{\tt (T value) = \ttkey{min of}
			( type T )} \\
\hspace*{-0.3in}{\tt (T value) = \ttkey{max of}
			( type T )} \\
Returns the minimum or maximum value of a type \TT{T}.
These are defined only for number types and enumeration types,
and for enumeration types the values returned are the limits of
the type's {\em enum-range}.

\hspace*{-0.3in}{\tt (T value) = \ttkey{min assigned of}
			( type T )} \\
\hspace*{-0.3in}{\tt (T value) = \ttkey{max assigned of}
			( type T )} \\
Returns the minimum or maximum values actually assigned to an
enumeration type \TT{T} by an {\em enum-assignment}.  Values
assigned by unchecked conversions are not considered.  If
no values have been assigned, {\em first-enum} is returned as
one of the assigned values and the other assigned value is such
that the difference of assigned values is \TT{-1}.
In any case the maximum assigned value minus the minimum assigned value
plus \TT{1} is the number of assigned values.
It is a compile time error if \TT{T} is not an enumeration type.

These values may change when more code is compiled or linked.
You may only assume that constants of type \TT{T} whose values have
already been compiled or linked are within
the range given by these values.

\hspace*{-0.3in}{\tt (int8 s, U c) = \ttkey{coefficients of}
			( type T )} \\
\TT{T} must be an enumeration or builtin integer
type with underlying type \TT{U}.
Then for every value \TT{v} of type \TT{T}:
\begin{center}
\TT{U(v) == s * integer of (v) + c}
\end{center}
which is guarenteed to be within the range of \TT{U} (else the
enumeration type declarations involved would be in error).  It is
always true that \TT{s} equals \TT{+1} or \TT{-1}.  For builtin
integer types \TT{U} and \TT{T} are the same, \TT{s == +1},
and \TT{c == 0}.

\hspace*{-0.3in}{\tt (T value) = \ttkey{default value of}
			( type T )} \\
Returns a suitable default value for type \TT{T}.
Defined to return \TT{0} for builtin number types.
Must be defined by user for defined types.  For use by allocators,
such as a user defined function that allocates a vector whose
elements are of type \TT{T}, and the function wishes to give the elements an
initial default value.

\hspace*{-0.3in}{\tt (bool value) = ( type T1 ) \ttkey{>} ( type T2 )} \\
Returns \TT{true} if and only if \TT{T1 > T2} in the sense that values
of type \TT{T1} can be implicitly converted to values of type \TT{T2}
(see \pagref{CONVERSION-RELATION}).
\end{indpar}

For all these functions it is a compile time error if their arguments
do not have a compile time value.

\section{Qualifiers}
\label{QUALIFIERS}

Variables may be qualified by \skey{qualifier}s, which preceed the
type when a variable is declared.  There are four builtin qualifiers
described in Section~\itemref{BUILTIN-QUALIFIERS} that have special
effects: \TT{mem}, \TT{stack}, \TT{*UNCHECKED*}, and \TT{trace}.
Other qualifiers may be defined, and are typically used to add an
additional layer of type checking that is somewhat orthogonal to
types.

Syntactically {\em qualifier-names} immediately preceed the {\em type-names}
that are before {\em variable-names}.  Some introductory examples are:
\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
qualifier fee
required qualifier fie
fee int32 result = F ( fee fie int32 value ):
    // Declares function F that computes a result of type
    // int32 from a value of type int32 and qualifier fie.
    // Requires call argument to have qualifier fie, but
    // not fee.
    //
    ... [Function body omitted] ...

// Example usage:
//
fie int32 x1 = ...
fee int32 x2 = ...
int32 y1 = F ( x1 )          // Legal; x1 has required fie.
int32 y2 = F ( x2 )          // Illegal; x2 does not have
                             // required fie.
protected prohibited qualifier fo
fo int32 result = G ( int32 value ):
    // Declares function G that computes a result of type
    // int32 from a value of type int32 that does NOT have
    // qualifier fo, which is prohibited.  Attaches fo, which
    // is also protected, to the result.
    //
    ... [Function body omitted] ...

fee int32 y3 = G ( x1 )      // Legal; y3 also acquires fo.
fee int32 y4 = G ( y3 )      // Illegal; y3 has implied
                             // qualifier fo.
fo  int32 y5 = 9             // Illegal; fo is protected.
fo  int32 y6 = y3            // Legal; y3 has implied fo.
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

The qualifiers may be declared by:
\begin{indpar}
\emkey{qualifier-declaration}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{rl}
    ::= & {\em qualifier-attribute}\STAR{} \ttkey{qualifier}
           {\em defined-qualifier-name} \\
    $|$ & {\em trace-qualifier-declaration}
    	  ~~~ [see \pagref{TRACE-QUALIFIERS}]
    \end{tabular} \\
\emkey{qualifier-attribute}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{rl}
    ::= & \ttkey{required} \\
    $|$ & \ttkey{prohibited} \\
    $|$ & \ttkey{protected} \\
    $|$ & \ttkey{inherited} \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

If a function prototype variable (argument or result) has
a \key{required qualifier}, any call variable matched to this
prototype variable must have the required qualifier.

If a function prototype variable (argument or result)
does \underline{not}
have a \key{prohibited qualifier}, any call variable matched to this
prototype variable must \underline{not} have the prohibited qualifier.

A qualifier \underline{can} be both required and prohibited.
Given a function prototype variable with such a qualifier,
a matching call variable must always have to have the qualifier,
and given a function prototype variable without such a qualifier,
a matching call variable must never have the qualifier.

If a function prototype result variable has a \key{protected
qualifier}, any call variable matched to this
prototype variable will be given the protected qualifier
(if it does not already have it).  Furthermore, no variable
may have the protected qualifier unless it is matched to
a function result variable with the qualifier.

In the above example, 
any call variable matched to the argument of \TT{F}
must have the `\TT{fie}' qualifier, which is required.
Any call variable matched to the argument of \TT{G}
must \underline{not} have the `\TT{fo}' qualifier, which is prohibited.
The `\TT{fo}' qualifier can only be placed on a variable that is
the result of a function like \TT{G} which attaches it to its result,
as `\TT{fo}' is protected.  `\TT{fee}' and `\TT{fie}' can be attached
to any variable, as they are \underline{not} protected.

Inherited qualifiers affect cluster variables and their behavior is
specified on page~\pagref{INHERITED-QUALIFIER}. 

Given a simple assignment of one variable value to another of the
form
\begin{center}
{\em result-qualifier}\STAR{}~~{\em result-type}~~{\em result-variable}%
    ~~\TT{=}~~%
    {\em source-qualifier}\STAR{}~~{\em source-type}~~{\em source-variable}
\end{center}
the following rules apply by default if the {\em result-type} is the
same as the {\em source-type} or there is a builtin conversion, implied
or \TT{*UNCHECKED*}, from the {\em source-type} to the {\em result-type}
(in the \TT{*UNCHECKED*}
case, \TT{*UNCHECKED*} must be a {\em result-qualifier}):
\begin{enumerate}
\item If there is a required {\em source-qualifier} \TT{Q}, it
must also be a {\em result-qualifier}.
\item If there is a prohibited {\em result-qualifier} \TT{Q}, it
must also be a {\em source-qualifier}.
\item If there is a protected {\em source-qualifier} \TT{Q}, it
is automatically added as a {\em result-qualifier}.
\end{enumerate}

The builtin qualifiers are in effect declared by:
\begin{indpar}
\TT{protected~qualifier~}\ttkey{mem} \\
\TT{prohibited~protected~inherited~qualifier~}\ttkey{stack} \\
\TT{required qualifier~}\ttkey{*UNCHECKED*} \\
\TT{qualifier~}\ttkey{trace}
\end{indpar}

The type `\ttkey{qualifier}' is a builtin enumeration type implicitly
declared after the manner of
\begin{indpar}
\TT{type~}\ttkey{qualifier}\TT{~is unswrd with enum [0~..]} \\
\TT{qualifier}~\ttkey{missing}\TT{~is next enum // 0}
\end{indpar}
Each qualifier is associated with a unique enumeration value
of type `\TT{qualifier}', and this value can be used at both
compile and run time to test whether two `\TT{qualifier}'s are
equal.

\section{Names and Abbreviations}
\label{NAMES-AND-ABBREVIATIONS}

A \key{name} is a sequence of lexemes used to name things like
variables and functions.

\begin{indpar}\label{NAMES}
\emkey{name} ::= {\em name-component} {\em member-selector}\STAR{} \\
\emkey{member-selector} ::= {\em member-name} $|$ {\em member-subscript} \\
\emkey{member-name} := {\em name-component} beginning with `\TT{.}' \\
\emkey{name-component} ::=
    {\em name-item} {\em continuing-name-item}\STAR{} \\
\emkey{continuing-name-item} := {\em name-item} not containing `\TT{.}' \\
\emkey{name-item} \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}rl}
    ::= & {\em word} with no embedded or ending `\TT{.}'s \\
        & [see text about splitting words with embedded `\TT{.}'s] \\
    $|$ & {\em quoted-mark} with no embedded or ending `\TT{.}'s \\
    $|$ & {\em quoted-separator} not containing `\TT{.}'s \\
    \end{tabular} \\
\emkey{quoted-mark} :::= \TT{"} {\em mark} \TT{"} \\
\emkey{quoted-separator} :::= \TT{"} {\em separator} \TT{"} \\
\emkey{member-subscript} ::= \TT{[}{\em member-index-list}\TT{]} \\
\emkey{member-index-list} \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}rl}
    ::= & {\em member-index} \\
    $|$ & {\em member-index} \TT{,} {\em member-index-list}
    \end{tabular} \\
\emkey{member-index} ::= {\em compile-time-integer-expression}
\end{indpar}

[We have not yet defined lexemes.  Roughly, separators are single
characters such as `\TT{(}' `\TT{)}' and `\TT{,}', marks are lexemes
that are not separators and do not contain letters or digits or `\TT{\#}',
words are lexemes that contain a letter before any digit, and
numerics are lexemes that contain either a digit before any letter
or contain `\TT{\#}'.]

{\em Words} containing embedded `\TT{.}'s are split into
{\em name-items} which can only contain `\TT{.}'s at their beginning.
Thus
\begin{center}
\TT{bills.wife.1.weight}
\end{center}
is split into
\begin{center}
\TT{bills~~~.wife~~~.1~~~.weight}
\end{center}
However, `\TT{.1}' is not a legal {\em name-item} and so cannot
be part of a {\em name}.

A variable of type \ttkey{name} can store a {\em name}.
Constants of type `\TT{name}' are made by \TT{`~'} quoting a {\em name}.
Two \TT{name} values can be
concatenated by the \TT{+} operator if the second begins with
a {\em member-selector}.  An
example is:
\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
name n1 = `jill'
name n2 = `.daughter[3]'
name n = n1 + n2  // n now = `jill .daughter[3]'
                  // or equivalently `jill.daughter[3]'
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

{\em Variable-names}, {\em type-names}, {\em qualifier-names},
{\em function-names}, etc.~are {\em names}.

An `\ttkey{abbreviation}' is name that is replaced in code by its value.
More specifically,
\begin{indpar}
\TT{type~}\ttkey{abbreviation}\TT{~is name}
\end{indpar}
is builtin, and given
\begin{center}
\TT{abbreviation V = `N'}
\end{center}
for any variable \TT{V} and name \TT{N}, any occurrance of
the name \TT{V} as an \underline{initial} subname of
a name in code within the scope of \TT{V} is replace by \TT{N} during
compilation.  Here a `\key{subname}' is a sequence of {\em name-components}
and {\em member-subscripts} within a name (i.e., a subname cannot
contain a \underline{partial} {\em name-component}),
and an `\key{initial subname}' is a subname that begins at the beginning
of the name that contains it.
If there is more than one replaceable initial subname
in a name, the longest is replaced.  After replacement, the complete name is
reinspected for possible additional abbreviations: that is, abbreviation
replacement in names is recursive.  However, abbreviation replacement
is done after other parsing; abbreviations may replace operators, but
only after the operators have been used to insert implied parentheses.

For example:
\begin{indpar}[0.1in]\begin{verbatim}
name ni = `i'
abbreviation nj = `j'
abbreviation nnj = `nj'
int32 nj = 5       // Legal: same as j = 5
int32 ni = 6       // Illegal variable overlay: same as ni = 6.
next nj = 6        // Legal variable overlay:
                   //       same as next j = 6
int32 r = nnj      // Legal: same as r = j (nnj => nj => j)
abbreviation "+.+" = `+'
int32 i = ( 4 ) +.+ ( 5 )
    // Legal; ( 4 ) "+" ( 5 ) which is what 4 + 5 becomes
    // after parsing.  However, 4 +.+ 5 will be illegal as
    // the parser will not treat +.+ as an operator, will
    // not insert implied parentheses, and therefore post-
    // parsing will not recognize +.+ as a name.
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

If an abbreviation is referenced in code being compiled, the value
of the abbreviation variable must be available to the compilation.
This does \underline{not} mean the value of every abbreviation
variable must be compile-time, as such a variable may be computed
at run-time and then used in a `\TT{compile-and-run}' assignment
statement: see Section~\itemref{COMPILE-AND-RUN-ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS}.


\section{Assignment Statements}
\label{ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS}

Code is executed in blocks, which are described in more detail
below, and block executions have stacks that contain \underline{all}
their variables.
These variables are allocated and their values are computed by
assignment statements:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{simple-assignment-statement}
    ::= \{ {\em result-variable-list} \TT{=} \}\QMARK{}
        {\em expression}
\\[0.5ex]
\emkey{result-variable-list}\label{RESULT-VARIABLE-LIST}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}rl}
    ::= & {\em result-variable-declaration} \\
    $|$ & \TT{(~}{\em result-variable-declaration} \\
        & ~~~~~~~~~~
	  \{ \TT{,} {\em result-variable-declaration} \}\STAR{} \TT{)} \\
    \end{tabular}
\\[0.5ex]
\emkey{result-variable-declaration}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}rl}
    ::= & {\em qualifier-name}\STAR{} {\em type-name} {\em variable-name} \\
    $|$ & \ttkey{next} {\em variable-name}
    \end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

This allocates new variables of the given {\em variable-names}, types,
and qualifiers
to the stack and stores values from the {\em expression} in the variables
({\em qualifiers} are described in section \itemref{QUALIFIERS}).
The {\em expression} produces a list of values, and this list must have
at least as many elements as there are variables.  Each variable is
assigned its value in order.  If the {\em expression} produces
too many values, the excess values at the end of the value list will be
discarded.

The value assigned to each variable
must be implicitly convertable to the variable's type, unless
the variable has the \TT{*UNCHECKED*} qualifier, in which case
the value must be convertable by unchecked conversion to the
variable's type.

The {\em expression} may only input values that are constants or are
the values of other variables in the same function execution
stack (including
arguments passed to the function execution).  In particular,
no input can come \underline{directly}
from RAM memory outside the function execution stack
(but see \pagref{MEM} and Section~\itemref{THE-MEM-QUALIFIER}
for ways to load RAM values into stack variables).
See Section~\itemref{STACK-MANAGEMENT} for more information about stacks.

Implicitly when a variable value is set this way, the value is first
computed in a register, then stored in the stack, and for some time
afterwards the value is left in the register which becomes a cache
on the stack value.  This cacheing is hidden from the programmer.

If a variable value is copied from another variable, usually the
new variable simply becomes a compile-time alias for the old variable.
No executable copy code is created, no new register is allocated, and no new
value is pushed into the stack.

Similarly if a variable value can be computed from previous variable
values by in-line code, 
its value may not be pushed into the stack.  Instead its
value can be recovered at any time by repeating the computation
of the variable from the other values.

Two variables in the same block of code may not have the same
name.  Thus variables are only assigned values once.

However, if an assignment statement uses the word `\TT{next}' in
place of the {\em qualifiers} and {\em type-name}
of a variable being assigned a value, then the named variable must
have been previously assigned a value within the same block,
and a new variable with the same
name, type, and qualifiers as the previous variable is allocated,
and the new variable supercedes the previous variable in subsequent code within
the block.

Note that `\TT{next}' behaves differently for loop interation
variables (see below) than it does for other variables.

All assignment statements have a special case where there are
no variables being assigned, the {\em variables-list} is omitted,
and the \TT{=} is also omitted.  In this case the
{\em simple-assignment-statement} reduces to just an {\em expression}
that executes for side effects (such as
input/output or non-stack memory modification).

Some examples of {\em simple-assignment-statements} are:
\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
int32 x = 1
int32 y = x + 1
next x = 10 * x         // Now x == 10
next y = x + 1          // Now y == 11
int32 z = 257
*UNCHECKED* int8 u = z  // *UNCHECKED* conversion used:
                        // Now u == 1
float64 m = 1.7
int32 i = m             // Illegal: undefined implicit
                        // conversion
*UNCHECKED* int32 j = m // *UNCHECKED* conversion used:
                        // now j == 1
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

\subsection{Block Assignment Statements}
\label{BlOCK-ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS}

Another variant of the assignment statement is\index{block assignment}:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{block-assignment-statement}
    ::= \begin{tabular}[t]{l}
        \{ {\em result-variable-list} \TT{=} \}\QMARK{}
	\ttkey{do}\QMARK{} \TT{:} \\
	\TT{~~~~}{\em statement}\STAR{}
	\end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

where `\TT{do}' may be omitted as long as \TT{=} is not omitted.

The {\em statements} in the block can include
{\em assignment-statements} in which {\em variable-declarations}
are replaced by simple {\em variable-names}
if these variables have the same name as a variable
in the {\em block-assignment-statement's} {\em result-variable-list}.
These {\em statements} assign values to the variables
in the {\em block-assignment-statement's} {\em result-variable-list}.
Furthermore, every variable in the
{\em block-assignment-statement's} {\em result-variable-list}
\underline{must} be assigned a value
by exactly one of the {\em statements} in the block.
Also the value of one of these variables cannot
be input to any of the {\em statements} in the block until the
variable has been assigned a value by a previous one of these
{\em statements}.

Variables allocated in the block are not visible outside the
block.  They may \underline{not} have the same name as a variable
\TT{v} visible outside the block,  and they may \underline{not}
have the name `\TT{next v}' where  \TT{v} is visible outside the block.

An example of a {\em block-assignment-statement} is:
\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
int32 x = 1
float64 y = 1.67
int64 z, *UNCHECKED* uns8 w, next x =:

    z = 16,777,216   // Legal, z is result variable
    x = 265          // Illegal, x is NOT result variable
    float64 y = 2.6  // Illegal, y is visible outside block
    uns8 v = 55      // Legal, v is NOT visible outside block
    next x = 266     // Legal, next x is result variable,
                     //        now x == 266
    next y = 2.6     // Illegal, y is visible outside block
                     //          and next y is not result
                     //          variable
    w = x            // Legal, sets w to 10 as x is now 266
                     //        and w is *UNCHECKED*
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

\subsection{Conditional Assignment Statements}
\label{CONDITIONAL-ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS}

\ikey{Conditional assignment statements}{conditional assignment}
are similar to block assignment statements:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{conditional-assignment-statement} ::= \\
\hspace*{0.5in}\begin{tabular}[t]{l}
        \{ {\em result-variable-list} \TT{=} \}\QMARK{} \ttkey{if}\TT{:} \\
	\TT{~~~~}\ttkey{default}\TT{:} \\
	\TT{~~~~~~~~~}{\em statement}\STAR{} \\
	\TT{~~~~}\TT{default:} \\
	\TT{~~~~~~~~~}{\em statement}\STAR{} \\
	\TT{~~~~}\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots \\
	\TT{~~~~}{\em condition-expression}\TT{:} \\
	\TT{~~~~~~~~~}{\em statement}\STAR{} \\
	\TT{~~~~}{\em condition-expression}\TT{:} \\
	\TT{~~~~~~~~~}{\em statement}\STAR{} \\
	\TT{~~~~}\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots \\
	\TT{~~~~}\ttkey{else}\TT{:} \\
	\TT{~~~~~~~~~}{\em statement}\STAR{} \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

In this case the {\em condition-expressions} are evaluated in order
until either one evaluates to true or the `\TT{else}' condition is
reached, and then the {\em statements} subject to the
first true condition (a.k.a the \key{subblock} of that condition)
are executed, or if no condition is true, the {\em statements}
of the `\TT{else}' subblock are executed.  Each separate subblock of
{\em statements} must set \underline{every} variable
in the {\em condition-assignment-statement's} {\em result-variable-list} exactly
once, with exceptions for defaults described next.

A {\em conditional-assignment-statement} with a
{\em result-variable-list} may have
`\ttkey{default}\TT{:}' subblocks.  Each assigns one or more
variables in the {\em result-variable-list}.  After any non-default subblocks
that are going to execute have executed, if there are any unset
variables in the {\em result-variable-list},
enabled default subblocks are executed
in order.  A default subblock is enabled if and
only if \underline{all} of the
{\em result-variable-list} variables set by the default subblock have
\underline{not} been set yet.

No two default subblocks may set the same {\em result-variable-list}
variable.  This rule is purely to prevent overly clever code that
uses the execution of earlier default blocks to disable the
execution of later default blocks.

Every variable in the {\em result-variable-list} \underline{must} be set by some
single subblock that executes.  A variable in the
{\em result-variable-list} cannot be read by a subblock {\em statement}
unless it is set by a previous {\em statement} in the
same subblock.

An example is:
\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
float64 result = max ( float64 x, float64 y, float64 z ):
    result = if:
        default:
            result = NaN
        x => y and x => z:
            result = x
        y => z && y => x:
            result = y
        z => y && z => x:
            result = z
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

where \TT{NaN} means `\key{not-a-number}' and is the missing
value for \TT{float64} variables.  \TT{x~=>~y} is true if
and only if neither \TT{x} nor \TT{y} is a \TT{NaN} and
\TT{x} is equal to or greater than \TT{y}.  Thus if any of
\TT{x}, \TT{y}, or \TT{z} in the above conditional assignment
is a \TT{NaN}, none of the non-\TT{default} {\em conditional-expressions}
will be true, and the \TT{default} will be evaluated to set
the \TT{result} to a \TT{NaN}.

\subsection{Loop Assignment Statements}
\label{LOOP-ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS}

\ikey{Loop assignment statements}{loop assignment}
are similar to block assignment
and conditional assignment statements.  An example is:
\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
// Calculate the sum of i for i == 1 to i == n.
//
int64 n = . . .
int64 sum = loop:
    initially:
        int64 i = 1
        int64 partial sum = 0
    while i <= n:
        next partial sum = partial sum + i
        next i = i + 1
    finally:
        sum = partial sum
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}



The general syntax of loop assignment statements is:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{loop-assignment-statement} ::= \\
\hspace*{0.5in}\begin{tabular}[t]{l}
        \{ {\em result-variable-list} \TT{=} \}\QMARK{}
	          \ttkey{loop:} \\
	\TT{~~~~}\ttkey{initially}\TT{:} \\
	\TT{~~~~~~~~~}{\em assignment-statement}\STAR{} \\
	\TT{~~~~}\ttkey{while} {\em condition-expression}\TT{:} \\
	\TT{~~~~~~~~~}{\em statement}\STAR{} \\
	\TT{~~~~}\ttkey{finally}\TT{:} \\
	\TT{~~~~~~~~~}{\em statement}\STAR{} \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

This is somewhat like the conditional assignment statement
except the `\TT{while}' subblock is iterated and there are iteration
variables defined by the `\TT{initially}' subblock.

The \skey{iteration variable}s are the
{\em result-variables} of the
{\em assignment-statements} executed by the `\ttkey{initially}' subblock.
Each iteration of the loop gives these variables new values using
`\TT{next v}' to refer to the next value of \TT{v}, where \TT{v}
is an iteration variable.  In the example `\TT{i}' and
`\TT{partial sum}' are iteration variables.

The iteration subblock is qualified by `\ttkey{while}'
{\em condition-expression}' and only executes if the
{\em condition-expression} evaluates to true.  Then
for every iteration variable \TT{v}
it must set the variable `\TT{next v}' or `\TT{next next v}',
as indicated below.

Lastly, when
the {\em condition-expression} evaluates to false, the
subblock qualified by `\ttkey{finally}'
executes, and it must set all the variables in the
loop statement's {\em result-variable-list}.  At this point the loop stops
executing.

Loops are always in effect unravelled so multiple copies of
the `\TT{while}' subblock exist at one time.
`\TT{next v}' refers to \TT{v} in the
next iteration of the loop, which exists simultaneously with
the current iteration.  `\TT{next next v}' refers to \TT{v}
in the next iteration to the next iteration of the loop, which
also exists simultaneously with the current iteration.

For a given iteration variable \TT{v},
either the `\TT{initially}' subblock sets \TT{v}
and the `\TT{while}' subblock sets `\TT{next v}',
or the `\TT{initially}' subblock sets both \TT{v} and `\TT{next v}'
and the `\TT{while}' subblock sets `\TT{next next v}'.
Values of `\TT{next v}' and `\TT{next next v}' may be stored in
the stack memory of an iteration that will never be executed.

The \TT{finally} subblock executes at the end using the iteration
variable values that would be used for an additional iteration,
were such an iteration to exist.

There are always at least 4 iterations of the loop with variables
simultaneously in the current execution frame stack: the current iteration,
the previous iteration (if any), and the next two iterations.
When the third iteration of the loop starts, the first
iteration can be discarded, and so forth.

The stack (\itemref{STACK-MANAGEMENT})
of a loop iteration subblock may be deallocated when the
iteration subblock finishes executing.
However, deallocation of some of these stacks may be deferred by
an implementation, which may allow debuggers to look at them
in some circumstances.

Any iteration variable \TT{v} \underline{cannot} be referenced
within either the `\TT{initially}' or `\TT{while}' blocks
after `\TT{next v}' has been assigned in the block.
However `\TT{next v}' can be referenced.

Similarly `\TT{next v}' cannot be referenced
after `\TT{next next v}' has been assigned in the block.
However `\TT{next next v}' can be referenced.

These rules exist to reduce confusion with the non-iteration
case where the forbidden references have a very different meaning.%
\footnote{Perhaps we should use `\TT{new v}' for non-iteration
variables, forbid `\TT{new v}' for iteration variables, and
allow unrestricted access to \TT{v} and `\TT{next v}' after the
latter is assigned.}


\subsection{Call Assignment Statements}
\label{CALL-ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS}

Note that functions are most commonly inline, and not out-of-line.
Inline functions are described later in Section~\itemref{FUNCTIONS}.

\ikey{Call assignment statements}{call assignment}
are used to call out-of-line functions:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{call-assignment-statement} ::= \\
\hspace*{0.5in}\begin{tabular}[t]{l}
        \{ {\em result-variable-list} \TT{=} \}\QMARK{}
	        {\em call-assignment-option}\STAR
		~\ttkey{call}~ {\em function-expression} \TT{:} \\
	\TT{~~~~}{\em assignment-statement}\STAR{}
	\end{tabular} \\[1ex]
\emkey{call-assignment-option}
	\begin{tabular}[t]{rl}
	::= & \ttkey{*UNCHECKED*} $|$ \ttkey{*REVERSE*}
	                          $|$ \ttkey{*NO-RELOAD*} \\
	$|$ & \ttkey{*COMPILE-TIME*} $|$ \ttkey{*COMPILE-TIME-ONLY*}
	\end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

The {\em function-expression} evaluates to a function to be called,
and its type \TT{T} must have the \TT{adr} type as its base type.
The values of the variables created by the {\em assignment-statements}
are the arguments to the function.
The results of the function call are stored in the
{\em result-variable-list} variables.

A call assignment must have the \TT{*UNCHECKED*} option
unless \TT{T} is declared by an out-of-line
function type declaration of the form:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{function-type-declaration} ::= \\
\hspace*{0.5in}\begin{tabular}[t]{l}
		\TT{function type}
		    \{ {\em result-variable-list } \TT{=} \}\QMARK{} \\
		\TT{~~~~~~~~}{\em call-assignment-option}\STAR{}
		    {\em defined-type-name}\TT{:} \\
		\TT{~~~~}{\em argument-variable-declaration}\STAR{}
	\end{tabular}
\\[0.5ex]
\emkey{argument-variable-declaration}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}rl}
    ::= & {\em qualifier-name}\STAR{} {\em type-name} {\em variable-name} \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

This makes \TT{adr} the base type of the new
defined type, and declares the prototype
for the function.
Then a call assignment block is type-checked by matching
the variable names in the call assignment block
to those in the prototype.  Thus in this case the order of variables
in the call block does not matter as their values will be
reordered according to the prototype.  Also, in this case
a call block argument
may be of different
type than corresponding prototype argument if there is an implied
conversion from the call block
argument type to the prototype argument type,
in which case the implied conversion will be invoked.
(Note, however, that if the prototype argument has the
\TT{*UNCHECKED*} qualifier, an unchecked conversion may be implied,
which can have unintended consequences.)

Out-of-line functions are defined by declarations of the form:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{out-of-line-function-declaration} ::= \\
\hspace*{0.5in}\begin{tabular}[t]{l}
		\TT{function}
		    \{ {\em result-variable-list } \TT{=} \}\QMARK{} \\
		\TT{~~~~~~~~}{\em call-assignment-option}\STAR{}
		    {\em function-type-name} {\em function-name}\TT{:} \\
		\TT{~~~~}{\em argument-variable-declaration}\STAR{} \\
		\TT{~~~~do:} \\
		\TT{~~~~~~~~}{\em statement}\STAR{} \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{indpar}\label{OUT-OF-LINE-FUNCTIONS}

This defines {\em function-name} to be both a compile-time and run-time
constant (with different values at compile and run time) of type
{\em function-type-name} and also declares {\em function-type-name}
after the manner of a {\em function-type-declaration}.  When the function
is called, the {\em statements} of its `\TT{do}' subblock execute to produce the
result variable values from the argument variable values.

If there is no function prototype (so the call is \TT{*UNCHECKED*}),
there is no matching of
argument variable names to prototype variable names.  In this case
normally arguments are passed to the function in the order they
appear in the call block,
top to bottom, left to right, which is the order in which they
are computed.  However, in this case the
\ttkey{*REVERSE*} option reverses the order in which the arguments
are passed, so the first computed is the last passed.

Normally a `\TT{reload mem}' statement (see \itemref{THE-RELOAD-COMMAND})
is executed automatically
upon returning from the called function, but the
\ttkey{*NO-RELOAD*} option suppresses this.

A \TT{*COMPILE-TIME*} out-of-line function will be callable at
compile time.  It may not reference Global Areas that are
not compile-time (see Section~\itemref{GLOBAL-AREAS}).
See Section~\itemref{COMPILE-TIME-ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS}.

A \TT{*COMPILE-TIME*} out-of-line function will also be callable at
run time.  But a
\TT{*COMPILE-\EOL TIME-\EOL ONLY*} out-of-line function will only be callable
at compile time.

The \TT{*REVERSE*} option requires the \TT{*UNCHECKED*}
option and the absence of a function prototype.

Normally the standard call linkage for the computer environment of
the program is used.  Other implementation specific call options
may alter the call linkage used.

\subsection{Out-of-Line Assignment Statements}
\label{OUT-OF-LINE-ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS}

An \key{out-of-line assignment statement} is like a combination of
a {\em call-assignment-statement} with
an {\em out-of-line-function-declaration}:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{out-of-line-assignment-statement} ::= \\
\hspace*{0.5in}\begin{tabular}[t]{l}
        \{ {\em result-variable-list} \TT{=} \}\QMARK{}
	        {\em call-assignment-option}\STAR
		~\ttkey{out-of-line} \TT{:} \\
	\TT{~~~~}{\em assignment-statement}\STAR{} \\
	\TT{~~~~do:} \\
	\TT{~~~~~~~~}{\em statement}\STAR{} \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

An {\em out-of-line-function-declaration} is constructed from this statement
by replacing the `\TT{out-\EOL of-\EOL line}' keyword by
an internally generated {\em function-type-name}
and {\em function-name}, and converting each {\em assignment-statement}
to an {\em argument-variable-declaration}.
Then this statement is executed as a {\em call-assign\-ment-statement}
using the {\em function-name} and deleting the `\TT{do}' subblock
{\em statements}.

{\em Out-of-line-assignment-statements} are generally included in
inline functions which preprocess arguments and may use various
{\em out-of-line-assignment-statements} to handle complex subcases.
When compiled multiple times in different contexts, the same
{\em out-of-line-assignment-statement} may be optimized in different
ways, and produce different out-of-line functions.  When it produces
the same out-of-line function more than once, this out-of-line function will
\underline{not} be duplicated.


\subsection{Compile-and-Run Assignment Statements}
\label{COMPILE-AND-RUN-ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS}

A \key{compile-and-run assignment statement} computes a set of
variables that have values constant in a block, then compiles
the block using these constant values to optimize the compilation,
and lastly runs the block:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{compile-and-run-assignment-statement} ::= \\
\hspace*{0.5in}\begin{tabular}[t]{l}
        \{ {\em result-variable-list} \TT{=} \}\QMARK{}
		~\ttkey{compile-and-run} \TT{:} \\
	\TT{~~~~}{\em assignment-statement}\STAR{} \\
	\TT{~~~~do:} \\
	\TT{~~~~~~~~}{\em statement}\STAR{} \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

The variable values are set by the {\em assignment-statements}.
Then the `\TT{do}' subblock {\em statements} are compiled, using
the variable values to optimize the compilation.  Then the
compiled code is executed.  The variables in the {\em result-variable-list}
may be set by either
{\em assignment-statements} or `\TT{do}' subblock {\em statements} as for
a block assignment statement (see \itemref{BlOCK-ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS}).
If a variable \TT{v} not in the {\em result-variable-list}
is set by an {\em assignment-statement},
`\TT{next v}' can be set by a `\TT{do}' subblock {\em statement}, but
this will be a new variable whose value will not be available during
the compilation.

When the compile-and-run assignment statement is executed, the compiled
code will be saved in a table indexed by the values of the
variables set by the {\em assignment-statements}.  When the
compile-and-run assignment statement is re-executed, if these
variables have the same value they had during a previous execution,
the compilation will be bypassed and the previously compiled code used.
This optimization is required, but such previously compiled code
may be discarded if it has not been used in a long time.


\subsection{Assembly Assignment Statements}
\label{ASSEMBLY-ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS}

\ikey{Assembly assignment statements}{assembly assignment statement}
are used to embed assembler instructions in compiled code:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{assembly-assignment-statement} ::= \\
\hspace*{0.5in}\begin{tabular}[t]{l}
        \{ {\em result-variable-list} \TT{=} \}\QMARK{}
	    ~\TT{*UNCHECKED*}~\ttkey{*ASSEMBLY*:} \\
	\TT{~~~~}{\em assignment-statement}\STAR{} \\
	\TT{~~~~do:} \\
	\TT{~~~~~~~~}{\em assembler-instruction}\STAR{} \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

The variables, both those produced by the {\em assignment-statements}
and the result variables, are placed in registers
and their names become register names for the assembler instructions.
Assembler instructions are only permitted to reference these
registers, but load and store assembler instructions may be used.
The assembler instructions are written in the syntax of one of the
target machine assemblers.

The variables may have additional qualifiers which
are names of registers or groups of registers.  In this case
the variables will be allocated to the specified registers or
register groups.  Otherwise they will be allocated to target
machine specified register groups based on variable type.

If intermediate registers are needed, they should be listed at the
end of the {\em result-variable-list}.

\subsection{Compile-Time Assignment Statements}
\label{COMPILE-TIME-ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS}

\ikey{Compile-time assignment statements}{compile-time assignment statement}
run only once, when they are compiled, and produce variable values
at compile time:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{compile-time-assignment-statement} ::= \\
\hspace*{0.5in}\begin{tabular}[t]{l}
        \{ {\em result-variable-list} \TT{=} \}\QMARK{}
	    ~~~ \ttkey{compile-time:} \\
	\TT{~~~~}{\em statement}\STAR{}
	\end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

A compile-time block has its own stack, which is freed when the
block finishes executing.

Compile time blocks may only use compile time variables and values,
but may use visible inline functions, out-of-line functions
that have been declared to be compile-time, and global areas
that have been declared to be compile-time.

\section{Scopes}
\label{SCOPES}

A \key{declaration} is a statement the defines a name which
can be referenced in code.  Assignment statements also
introduce the names of their result variables, and serve
as declarations of these result variables.

Declarations are statements in blocks.  A declaration has
a \key{scope}, that is the set of statements in which any
name defined by the declaration is recognized.  The scope
of a declaration begins with the declaration itself, and
lasts to the end of smallest block containing the declaration.
The scope of a name is the scope of the declaration that defines
it.

Two different declarations of the same name may \underline{not}
have overlapping scope, except when the second declaration is
for `\TT{next} {\em variable-name}' and both declarations are
in the same smallest containing block.

The scope of a name consists of statements and subblocks.
By the last rule, a name may not be
redeclared in a subblock that is in the name's scope.
A corollary of this is that `\TT{next v}'
cannot be declared in a subblock that is in the scope
of `\TT{v}'.

\section{Functions}
\label{FUNCTIONS}

All functions are inline.  An inline function can call an out-of-line
function by using
a call assignment statement (\itemref{CALL-ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS})
or the out-of-line assignment statement
(\itemref{OUT-OF-LINE-ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS}).

Function declarations have the form:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{function-declaration}
    ::= \begin{tabular}[t]{l}
        {\em function-prototype}\TT{:} \\
	~~~~ {\em statement}\STAR{} \\
	\end{tabular}
\\[1ex]
\emkey{function-prototype}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}rl}
    ::= & {\em result-variable-list} \TT{=} {\em function-name}
	    {\em argument-variable-list}\QMARK{} \\
    $|$ & {\em function-name} {\em argument-variable-list}\QMARK{} \\
    $|$ & {\em function-name} {\em argument-variable-list}\QMARK{}
            \TT{=} {\em input-variable-list} \\
    $|$ & {\em function-prototype}
          \TT{[[} {\em qualifying-expression} \TT{]]} \\
    $|$ & {\em other} as per Section~\itemref{FUNCTION-PROTOTYPES-AND-CALLS} \\
    \end{tabular}
\\[1ex]
\emkey{qualifying-expression}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}rl}
    ::= & {\em call-compile-time-logical-expression} \\
    $|$ & {\em abbreviation-name} \TT{is} {\em call-compile-time-expression} \\
    $|$ & {\em other} as per Section~\itemref{FUNCTION-PROTOTYPES-AND-CALLS} \\
    \end{tabular}
\\[1ex]
\emkey{result-variable-list} ::= see \pagref{RESULT-VARIABLE-LIST} \\
\\[1ex]
\emkey{argument-variable-list}\label{ARGUMENT-VARIABLE-LIST}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}rl}
    ::= & \TT{(~}{\em argument-variable-declaration} \\
        & ~~~~~~~~~~
	  \{ \TT{,} {\em argument-variable-declaration} \}\STAR{} \TT{)} \\
    \end{tabular}
\\[0.5ex]
\emkey{argument-variable-declaration}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}rl}
    ::= & {\em qualifier-name}\STAR{} {\em type-name} {\em variable-name} \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

A function call with a {\em result-variable-list}
is in effect replaced by a {\em block-assignment-statement}
(Section~\itemref{BlOCK-ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS})
with the {\em function-declaration's} {\em result-variable-list} becoming the 
{\em result-variable-list} of the {\em block-assignment-statement} and the
{\em function-declaration's} subblock {\em statements} becoming the 
{\em block-\EOL assign\-ment-\EOL state\-ment's} subblock {\em statements}.
Actual argument values from the function call are assigned to variables in
the definition {\em argument-variable-list}.  The values produced in
the {\em result-variable-list's} variables become the values of the
function call when it is used as part of an {\em expression}.

When this is done, the names declared by {\em statements} in the
function block are in effect changed so they will not conflict
with names the call is within scope of.  Also, names not declared
in the function block but used in the block are resolved
in the context of the function block declaration itself,
and not in the context of a call to the function.

A function call without any {\em result-variable-list}
is just like a function call with an empty
{\em result-variable-list}.

A function call with an {\em input-variable-list} is just syntactic
sugar for a function call with neither a {\em result-variable-list}
or {\em input-variable-list}.  Specifically
\begin{center}
\TT{F(a1,a2,...)~=~(b1,b2,...)} \\
is syntactic sugar for \\
\TT{F(a1,a2,...)(b1,b2,...)} \\
\end{center}

where use is made of the fact that a function can have multiple
argument lists (Section~\itemref{FUNCTION-PROTOTYPES-AND-CALLS}).

An argument or return variable can have the `\TT{type}' type.
If an argument variable has type `\TT{type}', its value can be used as the
type of other argument variables that are
after it in the {\em argument-variable-list},
or of any result variable.  For example:

\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
( T result ) = add ( type T, T v1, T v2 ):
    result = v1 + v2

// Example usage
//
int32 x = ...
int32 y = ...
int32 z = add ( int32, x, y )
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

Type arguments can be implied, e.g., the first argument \TT{T}
in a call to `\TT{add}' as in:

\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
int32 z = add ( x, y )
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

Conditions can be written at the end of a {\em function-prototype},
as in:
\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
types signed-integer-types =
    {{ int8, int16, int32, int64, int128 }}

( T result ) = add ( type T, T v1, T v2 )
    [[ T in signed-integer-types ]]:
    result = v1 + v2
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

which would define `\TT{add}' only for signed integer types.
The conditions must be evaluatable whenever a call to the
function is compiled.

If an argument variable has type `\TT{qualifiers}',
its value is a set of qualifiers,
it can be used to denote the qualifiers of any variable
after it in the {\em argument-variable-list}, and it can be
used to compute qualifiers of either argument or result variables.
For example:
\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
( Qr pointer result ) =
    increment ( qualfiers Q, Q pointer value )
    [[ Qr is Q & {{ stack }} ]]:
    result = v1 + v2
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

Here \TT{Q} denotes the qualifiers of the `\TT{value}' argument
and \TT{Qr} is just an abbreviation of the more complex
qualifiers-valued expression defined by `\TT{[[ Qr is~}\ldots\TT{]]}'.

Arguments of type `\TT{qualifiers}' may be implied if they
denote the qualifiers of a given argument.  So in the above,
the \TT{Q} argument may be implied.

If `\TT{type}' or `\TT{qualifiers}' arguments can be implied
but are given explicitly instead, their values must be available
at compile time.

Since they are inline, functions can use abbreviation arguments as function
names.  An example is:
\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
( T r1, T r2 ) =
        sort2 ( type T, T x, T y, abbreviation less-than ):
    if:
        less-than ( x, y ):
            r1 = x; r2 = y
        else
            r1 = y; r2 = x

// Function that is like < except it makes a NaN less than
// a non-Nan ( < is false if either argument is NaN ).
//
bool r = less-than-float64 ( float64 x, float64 y )
    r = if:
        is-Nan ( x ): r = true
        x < y:        r = true
        else:         r = false

float64 b1 = 5.37857
float64 b2 = 5.37289
( float64 c1, float64 c2 ) =
    sort2 ( b1, b2, `less-than-float64' )
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

However, as names in a function block are resolved in the context
of the function block declaration, and not in the context of a
call, the following fails:
\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
( T r1, T r2 ) = sort2 ( type T, T x, T y ):
    if:
        less-than ( x, y ):
            r1 = x; r2 = y
        else
            r1 = y; r2 = x

// Function that is like < except it makes a NaN less than
// a non-Nan ( < is false if either argument is NaN ).
//
bool r = less-than-float64 ( float64 x, float64 y )
    r = if:
        is-Nan ( x ): r = true
        x < y:        r = true
        else:         r = false

float64 b1 = 5.37857
float64 b2 = 5.37289
( float64 c1, float64 c2 ) = sort2 ( b1, b2  )
    // Illegal because `less-than' in function block is
    // not defined when function block was declared.
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

Much more complex {\em function-prototypes} can be written:
see Calls, \itemref{FUNCTION-PROTOTYPES-AND-CALLS}.

\subsection{Temporary Variables}
\label{TEMPORARY-VARIABLES}

When a function call is used as an argument to another function
call, a temporary variable is created to hold the first result
variable of the inner function call, and the other result variables
of the inner call are discarded (unless they are hidden parts
of a cluster whose root
is the first result variable: see Section~\itemref{CLUSTERS}).
This temporary must be assigned a type
and qualifiers.  Depending upon these assignments, it may or
may not be possible to find function prototypes that can be
matched to the function calls in a statement.

The qualifiers assigned are always just the protected
qualifiers of the first result variable of the prototype matched
to an inner function call.

If there are several matches with different type assignments, the
following rule is used.  Let $i$ index the temporary variables,
and $i\mapsto T_i$ be a type assignment.  Define a partial order
on such type assignments to be
\begin{center}
$i\mapsto T^1_i~~~\leq~~~i\mapsto T^2_i$
\end{center}
if and only if for every $i$, values of type $T^2_i$ are implicitly
convertible to values of type $T^1_i$.  Then if the set of
possible type assignments has a minimum, that is used, and if
the minimum yields a unique matching of statement calls to
prototypes, the statement compiles without error.  Otherwise
the statement is ambiguous and its compilation is in error.

The type and some qualifiers of the results of inner calls can
be dictated by writing the inner call in the form:
\begin{center}
{\em qualifier-name}\STAR{} {\em type-name}\QMARK{}
    \TT{(} {\em inner-call} \TT{)}
\end{center}

This may specify the type and some of the qualifiers of the inner call
temporary result.  If the type is not specified, it will be computed
as in the proceding paragraphs.  The temporary will also be given any protected
qualifiers of the result variable of any prototype matched to the
inner call.

\section{Generics}
\label{GENERICS}

A \key{generic} is like an inline function except that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item All the arguments in a generic call must have compile-time values.
\item The generic call has no result variables.
\item The code in the generic block runs at compile-time and
      assigns its variables compile-time values.
\item There is an extra `\TT{include}' block consisting of
      statements that replace the generic call
      in the code that contains the call.  These included statements may
      contain the names of call arguments and computed block variables,
      including abbreviations, and these are replaced
      in the included statements by their values.
\end{enumerate}

Generic declarations have the form:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{generic-declaration}
    ::= \begin{tabular}[t]{l}
        {\em generic-prototype}\TT{:} \\
	\TT{~~~~}{\em assignment-statement}\STAR{} \\
	\TT{~~~~include:} \\
	\TT{~~~~~~~~}{\em statement}\STAR{} \\
	\end{tabular}
\\[1ex]
\emkey{generic-prototype}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}rl}
    ::= & \TT{generic} {\em generic-name}
	    {\em argument-variable-list}\QMARK{} \\
    $|$ & {\em other} as per Section~\itemref{FUNCTION-PROTOTYPES-AND-CALLS} \\
    $|$ & {\em generic-prototype}
          \TT{[[} {\em qualifying-expression} \TT{]]} \\
    \end{tabular}
\\[1ex]
{\em qualifying-expression} ::= see \pagref{QUALIFYING-EXPRESSION}
\end{indpar}

An example is:
\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
generic min-max functions ( type T ):
    include:
        T result = min ( T x, T y ):
            result = if:
                x <= y:
                    result = x
                y <= x:
                    result = y
                else
                    result = NaN
        T result = max ( T x, T y ):
            result = - min ( -x, -y )

min-max functions ( int64 )
int64 u = ...
int64 v = min ( u, -1,000,000 )
int64 w = max ( u, 1,000,000 )
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}



\section{Clusters}
\label{CLUSTERS}

A \key{cluster} is a group of related variables.  One variable of
the cluster is the \mkey{base variable}{of cluster} of the cluster, and the
other variables have names that are derived from the
name of the base variable adding {\em member-selectors}
to the end of the base variable name.  See \pagref{NAMES}.

Thus a cluster
is like a C/C++ structure, but it is a set of variables and not a
piece of memory.

More specifically, the members of the cluster can be named by
adding either a member name beginning with a `\TT{.}' or a
`\TT{[]}' bracketed list of
integer constant subscripts to
either the base variable name of the cluster or to another member name
of the cluster.  Two variable names with different base variable names
belong to different clusters.

Variables in clusters are thus organized into trees, with clusters
that have different bases being disjoint.  Any variable in a cluster
can be considered
as the \mkey{root}{of subcluster} of a subtree of cluster members, and
the subtree is called a \key{subcluster}.

The main feature of clusters and subclusters
is that members are passed to or returned
from functions implicitly when their the root variable is named
explicitly.  Furthermore, cluster members \underline{cannot}
be passed explicitly, and cannot be created except as results
of function calls.

For example:
\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
type pointer pair is void
    // if pp is a pointer pair then:
    //   unsadr pp.begin is the offset of the first element
    //   unsadr pp.end is the offset just AFTER the
    //                 last element
    //   mem adr pp.begin.base is the base address that
    //                         is added to the offsets
    //   *UNCHECKED* adr pp.begin.base.adr is the address of
    //                                     pp.begin.base
    //   type pp.type is type of element

// Function to allocate a vector of n T's to the stack.
//
( stack pointer pair pp,
  unsadr pp.begin,
  unsadr pp.end,
  mem adr pp.begin.base,
  *UNCHECKED* adr pp.begin.base.adr,
  type pp.type ) =
        allocate to stack ( type T, uns32 n ):
    require ( zero value OK ( T ) )
    pp.type = T
    unsadr length = size of ( T ) * n
    pp.begin = allocate to stack ( length )
        // This sets pp.begin.base and pp.begin.base.adr.
    pp.end = pp.begin + length


// Prefix operator to dereference a pointer pair to read
// memory.
//
( mem pp.type out,
  stack *UNCHECKED* out.offset,
  stack mem adr out.offset.base,
  *UNCHECKED* out.offset.base.adr ) =
        "*" ( stack pointer pair pp,
              type pp.type,
              unsadr pp.begin,
              unsadr pp.end,
              *UNCHECKED* adr pp.base.adr ):
    ( out.offset, out.base.adr ) = if:
        pp.begin < pp.end:
            out.offset = pp.begin
            out.offset.base.adr = pp.begin.base.adr
        else:
            fatal error
                ( "Deferencing empty pointer pair." )

// Note: the following function is builtin:
//
// ( *UNCHECKED* unsadr offset2,
//   mem adr offset2.base,
//   *UNCHECKED* adr offset2.base.adr ) =
//     "*" ( *UNCHECKED* unsadr offset,
//           *UNCHECKED* offset.base.adr ):
//     offset2 = offset
//     offset2.base.adr = offset.base.adr

// Prefix operator to dereference a pointer pair to
// write memory.
//
"*" ( stack pointer pair pp,
      unsadr pp.begin,
      unsadr pp.end,
      mem adr pp.begin.base,
      *UNCHECKED* adr pp.begin.base.adr,
      type pp.type ) =
        ( pp.type in ):
    if:
        pp.begin < pp.end:
            *WRITE* in pp.begin
        else:
            fatal error
                ( "Deferencing empty pointer pair." )

// Prefix operator to increment the begin pointer of a

//
( stack pointer pair pp2,
  unsadr pp2.begin,

  type pp2.type ) =
        "++" ( stack pointer pair pp,
               type pp.type,
               unsadr pp.begin,
               unsadr pp.end,
               *UNCHECKED* adr pp.base.adr ):
      pp2.begin = pp.begin + size of ( pp.type )
      pp2.end = pp.end
      pp2.base.adr = pp.base.adr
      pp2.type = pp.type

// Assignment operator for pointer pairs.
//
( stack pointer pair pp2,
  unsadr pp2.begin,
  unsadr pp2.end,
  mem adr pp2.base,
  *UNCHECKED* adr pp2.base.adr,
  type pp2.type )
        = ( stack pointer pair pp,
            type pp.type,
            unsadr pp.begin,
            unsadr pp.end,
            adr pp.base.adr ):
      pp2.begin = pp.begin
      pp2.end = pp.end
      pp2.base.adr = pp.base.adr
      pp2.type = pp.type

// Example usage:
//
    ... out-of-line function header ...

    // Vector of 2 int32's is allocated and the elements
    // are set equal to 100 and 101.
    //
    pointer pair pp = allocate to stack ( int32, 2 )
    * pp = 100
    next pp = ++ pp
    * pp = 101
    . . . .
    // Vector of 1000 float64's is summed.
    //
    pointer pair ppf = allocate to stack ( float64, 1000 )
    ... set 1000 elements ...
    float64 sum = loop:
        initially:
            float64 partial sum = 0
            pointer pair ppf2 = ppf
        while ppf2.begin < ppf2.end:
            next partial sum = partial sum + * ppf2
            next ppf2 = ++ ppf2
        finally:
            sum = partial sum
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

Note that although the functions defining operations on a pointer pairs
are a long winded, usage of pointer pairs is compact and easy.
This is a general characteristic of the L-Language, and derives
from the fact that the functions automatically manage the members
of a cluster.

Cluster member names may be used as prototype parameter
names, with the root of these names also being a prototype
parameter.  This specifies that the parameters are related
by being in the same cluster.

When this is done for prototype arguments, the cluster root must
also be an argument, and the cluster member values
will be derived from the root, and \underline{must}
be omitted in calls.  If the cluster members named as arguments
in the function prototype do not exist,
the function prototype does not match the call.

When this is done for prototype results, the cluster root must similarly
be a result, and the designated
members of the cluster are created and set from the results.
Again the cluster members \underline{must} be omitted in calls,
but will be automatically created.
Note that when this is done any qualifiers on the omitted cluster
members will be set by the prototypes.

Cluster members may only be created as function call results.

A variable of \TT{void} type has no actual value
and must not be assigned one.  Such variables are only useful
as cluster and subcluster roots.

In the above example `\TT{mem}' and `\TT{stack} are special builtin qualifiers
which can be applied to variables.
See \itemref{BUILTIN-QUALIFIERS}.

The `\TT{mem}' qualifier\label{MEM}
has the special property that given a variable
\TT{v} of qualifier \TT{mem}, then if \TT{v} is allocated,
and \TT{v.adr} of type \TT{adr} and qualifier \TT{*UNCHECKED*}
is allocated and
assigned a value, the root \TT{v} will also be automatically
assigned as its value the value read from RAM address \TT{v.adr}.
It is an error in this case to explicitly assign a value to \TT{v}.
This is how \TT{out.offset\EOL .base} gets its value from
\TT{out.offset.base.adr}.

In a similar but more complex fashion, if \TT{v.offset} of type
\TT{unsadr} (type \TT{intadr} can also be used) and \TT{*UNCHECKED*}
qualifier is allocated, and also \TT{v.offset.base} of type \TT{adr}
and either \TT{*UNCHECKED*} or \TT{mem} qualifier is allocated,
and both are assigned values (the latter possibly by allocating
and assigning \TT{v.offset.base.adr} of type \TT{adr} and
qualifier \TT{*UNCHECKED*}), then
the root \TT{v} will also be automatically
assigned as its value the value read from RAM address \TT{v.offset+v.base}.
This is how \TT{out} gets its value from \TT{out.offset}
and \TT{out\EOL .offset\EOL .base}.

For details on the `\TT{mem}' qualifier see \itemref{THE-MEM-QUALIFIER}.

The `\TT{stack}' qualifier has the property that values with
this qualifier may not be passed out of a block with a free
stack.  This keeps stack addresses from escaping contexts in
which they are valid.  See Sections~\itemref{THE-STACK-QUALIFIER} and
\itemref{STACK-MANAGEMENT}.

A qualifier may be \ikey{inherited}{qualifier}\label{INHERITED-QUALIFIER}.
If an inherited qualifier
is applied to the root variable of a cluster
or subcluster, this inherited qualifier is automatically applied to all
the member variables in the cluster or subcluster.  This is not done
for non-inherited qualifiers.

The `\TT{stack}' qualifier is inherited.

\section{Builtin Qualifiers}
\label{BUILTIN-QUALIFIERS}

\subsection{The Memory Qualifier}
\label{THE-MEM-QUALIFIER}

The \ttkey{mem} qualifier is a protected qualifier that behaves
in a special way when it is given to a variable \TT{v}.
In this situation \TT{v} is a copy of a RAM memory value and
must be the root of a subcluster that
has either:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
A variable \TT{v.adr} of type \TT{adr} with either of the qualifiers
\TT{mem} or \TT{*UNCHECKED*} that is the RAM address of \TT{v}.

\item
A variable \TT{v.offset} of type \TT{intadr} or \TT{unsadr} and
qualifier \TT{*UNCHECKED*}, and
a variable \TT{v.base} of type \TT{adr} and qualifier \TT{mem}
or \TT{*UNCHECKED*}.
In this case the RAM address of \TT{v} is \TT{v.base+v.offset}.
If \TT{v.base} has qualifier \TT{mem} it must recursively be
the root of a subcluster obeying
these rules (so there must be either a \TT{v.base.adr} variable
or \TT{v.base.offset} and \TT{v.base\EOL .base}
variables, etc.).
\end{enumerate}
The the
variable \TT{v} must \underline{not} be given a value by an
assignment statement, but will instead be loaded with a value
from its RAM address.  It is called a `\key{RAM cache variable}'.

Because \TT{mem} is a protected qualifier, \TT{v} and the required
members of the cluster of which \TT{v} is a root
must be created as matches to result variables of a function.
So only functions can effect a load of RAM contents to a variable.


\subsection{The Stack Qualifier}
\label{THE-STACK-QUALIFIER}

The `\ttkey{stack}' qualifier is an inherited, prohibited,
protected qualifier
attached to offsets and addresses
returned by the builtin `\TT{allocate to stack}'
function (\pagref{ALLOCATE-TO-STACK}).
It is used to keep these from being stored in
non-stack memory and in stacks who lifetime exceeds that of the
memory the stack address points at.

The special property of the `\TT{stack}' qualifier is that it cannot
be used to qualify variables in the {\em result-variable-list}
of a {\em call-assignment-statement},
{\em out-of-line-assignment-statement}, or
{\em compile-time-assignment-statement},
or iteration variables in a {\em loop-assignment-statement}.
This is so that stack addresses pointing into a free stack
cannot outlive the free stack.
See Section~\itemref{STACK-MANAGEMENT} for more information.

\subsection{The \TT{*UNCHECKED*} Qualifier}
\label{THE-UNCHECKED-QUALIFIER}

The \TT{*UNCHECKED*} qualifier is a
required qualifier that must qualify the \TT{v.adr} or
\TT{v.offset} variables
associated with a variable \TT{v} that has the \TT{mem} qualifier.
See Section~\itemref{THE-MEM-QUALIFIER}.

The \TT{*UNCHECKED*} qualifier is also required for the result variable
of an unchecked conversion.  When used for a result variable of an
assignment, the value assigned need only be convertable to the type
of the variable by an unchecked conversion, instead of by a checked
conversion.

The lexeme \TT{*UNCHECKED*} lexeme is also used as the initial part some
names. An example is the \TT{*UNCHECKED* *ASSEMBLY*} assignment statement.

\subsection{Trace Qualifiers}
\label{TRACE-QUALIFIERS}

A \key{trace qualifier} permits values to be marked so that they
can be found (i.e., `traced') by garbage collectors
(and occassionally debuggers)
when they are stored in the
stack.  A trace qualifier may be declared by:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{trace-qualifier-declaration}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{rl}
    ::= & \ttkey{trace qualifier}
           {\em defined-qualifier-name} \\
        & ~~~~~ \TT{with base type}~~{\em type-name}
    \end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

The base type of a trace qualifier may be determined by the
function with the prototype:
\begin{center}
{\tt (type T) = \ttkey{base type of} ( qualifier Q )}
\end{center}
The value of any variable with a trace qualifier must be
\TT{*UNCHECKED*} convertable to a value of the base type.

It is common to add a trace qualifier to the statement that
defines a type you want to trace.  An example in which the
qualifier is \TT{Q} and the type is \TT{T} is:
\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
trace qualifier Q with base type adr
type Q T is adr
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}
which causes all values of type \TT{T} in the stack to be
traced.

More specifically, when a value \TT{V} of a variable with the trace
qualifier \TT{Q} and base type \TT{B} is added to a stack,
\TT{V} converted to type \TT{B} is also
pushed into a (virtual or physical) \TT{Q}-stack of values of
type \TT{B}.
When the stack containing \TT{V} is freed, the corresponding
value in the \TT{Q}-stack is popped.  There is a \TT{Q}-stack
associated with every process and every global area.
Using functions in the
subroutine library (see TBD), these \TT{Q}-stacks can be read.

\subsection{The Reload Statement}
\label{THE-RELOAD-COMMAND}

The reload statement has the syntax:
\begin{center}
\ttkey{reload} {\em qualifier-name} \{ \TT{,} {\em qualifier-name} \}\STAR{}
\end{center}

This statement declares the values of all variables with the designated
qualifiers to be out-of-date and unusable.  If any of these variables
is used subsequently, statements to recompute the variable value
may be inserted automatically into the code at the point of the
\TT{reload} statement.

Variable values are recomputed in the same order as they were
originally computed.  How each variable is recomputed depends upon
how it was originally computed.

As a special case, if one of the qualifiers given is `\TT{mem}', and
a variable \TT{v} has the `\TT{mem}' qualifier and is the base of
a cluster that causes \TT{v} to be loaded from memory
(as per Section~\itemref{THE-MEM-QUALIFIER}), then the value
in RAM is assumed to have changed, and \TT{v} is declared to be out-of-date.
After the appropriate members of the \TT{v} cluster have been recomputed,
\TT{v} is reloaded from RAM.

If a variable \TT{v} was originally computed by
an {\em assignment-statement}
of the form `{\em type} \TT{v =} {\em expression}', then if
no input to {\em expression} is out-of-date, \TT{v} is not out-of-date.
Otherwise if all the inputs that are out-of-date can be recomputed,
\TT{v} is recomputed.  However, \TT{v} is not recomputed if this
recompuation requires evaluation of loops or out-of-line calls or
writes to RAM;
but it will be recomputed if evaluation can be done with a conditional
statement subblock that does not involve loops or out-of-line calls or
writes to RAM,
even if other subblocks of the conditional statement do involve such.

If an out-of-date variable value is not used after the \TT{reload} statement,
it is not recomputed.

\section{Memory Write Statements}
\label{MEMORY-WRITE-STATEMENTS}

Statements that write memory make use of cluster structures
similar to those used with
\TT{mem} qualifier variables:
see Section~\itemref{THE-MEM-QUALIFIER}.

Specifically, memory needs to be addressed.  This is done by either
of the following methods of specifying a RAM address:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
A variable \TT{va} of type \TT{adr} with either of the qualifiers
\TT{mem} or \TT{*UNCHECKED*} that contains the RAM address.
If \TT{va} has qualifier \TT{mem} it must recursively be
the root of a subcluster obeying
the rules of Section~\itemref{THE-MEM-QUALIFIER},
so there must be either a \TT{va.adr} variable
or \TT{va.offset} and \TT{va.offset\EOL .base}
variables, etc.


\item
A variable \TT{vo} of type \TT{intadr} or \TT{unsadr} and
qualifier \TT{*UNCHECKED*}, and
a variable \TT{vo.base} of type \TT{adr} and qualifier \TT{mem}
or \TT{*UNCHECKED*}.
In this case the RAM address is \TT{vo+vo.base}.
If \TT{vo.base} has qualifier \TT{mem} it must recursively be
the root of a subcluster obeying
the rules of Section~\itemref{THE-MEM-QUALIFIER},
so there must be either a \TT{vo.base.adr} variable
or \TT{vo.base.offset} and \TT{vo.base.offset\EOL .base}
variables, etc.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Single Value Write Statements}
\label{SINGLE-VALUE-WRITE-STATEMENTS}

The form of a single valued write statement is:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{single-value-write-statement} ::=
    \TT{*WRITE*} {\em value-variable} {\em address-variable}
\end{indpar}

The value in the {\em value-variable} is written to the RAM address
in the {\em address-variable}.

\subsection{Memory Copy Statements}
\label{MEMORY-COPY-STATEMENTS}

The form of a memory copy statement is:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{memory-copy-statement} ::=
    \TT{*COPY*} {\em source-variable} {\em destination-variable}
    		{\em length-variable}
\end{indpar}
Bytes are copied from the RAM address in the {\em source-variable}
to the RAM address in the {\em destin\-ation-\EOL variable}.
The number of bytes copied is in the {\em length-variable},
which must be of the \TT{unsadr} type.

If the source address is less than the destination address,
the bytes are copied in ascending address order.  If the
source address is greater than the destination address,
bytes are copied in descending address order.  If the two
addresses are equal, bytes may or may not be copied.  The effect of
all this is to copy regions of memory correctly even if they
overlap.


\subsection{Memory Set Statements}
\label{MEMORY-SET-STATEMENTS}

The form of a memory set statement is:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{memory-set-statement} ::=
    \TT{*SET*} {\em value-variable} {\em address-variable}
    		{\em length-variable}
\end{indpar}
The `set length' is stored in the {\em length-variable} which must
be of \TT{unsadr} type.  As long as the set length is not zero,
this statement performs a \TT{*WRITE*} operation on its
first two arguments, and then increments the address by
the length of the type of the value, and decrements the set length
by one.

\subsection{Atomic Memory Statements}
\label{ATOMIC-MEMORY-STATEMENTS}

An \key{atomic-memory-statement} is a generalization of
the classic compare-and-set instruction.  It is a block assignment
statement that executes a sequence of specialized instructions:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{atomic-memory-statement} ::= \\
\hspace*{0.5in}\begin{tabular}[t]{l}
        \TT{uns32 result = }\ttkey{*ATOMIC*} \TT{:} \\
	\TT{~~~~}{\em lock-instruction}\STAR{} \\
	\TT{~~~~}{\em compare-instruction}\STAR{} \\
	\TT{~~~~}{\em write-instruction}\STAR{} \\
	\end{tabular}
\\[0.5ex]
\emkey{lock-instruction} ::= \ttkey{*LOCK*} {\em lock-variable} \\
\emkey{compare-instruction} ::= \ttkey{*COMPARE*} {\em compare-variable} \\
\emkey{write-instruction} ::= \\
\hspace*{0.2in}\begin{tabular}[t]{rl}
        & \TT{*WRITE*} {\em valur-variable} {\em address-variable} \\
    $|$ & \TT{*COPY*} {\em source-variable} {\em destination-variable}
    		      {\em length-variable} \\
    $|$ & \TT{*SET*} {\em value-variable} {\em address-variable}
    		     {\em length-variable} \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

The special instructions,
which make use of clusters (Section~\itemref{CLUSTERS}),
and are as follows:
\begin{indpar}[0.4in]
\hspace*{-0.2in}{\em \bf Lock-Instruction}.
The {\em lock-variable} is of type \TT{uns32}
and identifies the lock.
The lock is a binary test-and-set lock provided by the
underlying system.  Locks are allocated to sets of processes
that share memory, so that if any process in the set gets
the lock, other processes in the set cannot.

The lock instruction sets the lock and succeeds if the lock
was not already set, and otherwise just fails.

When the {\em atomic-assignment-statement} terminates, either
successfully or when it fails, all locks gotten are released in
reverse order.

\hspace*{-0.2in}{\em \bf Compare-Instruction}.
The {\em compare-variable} is a RAM cache variable (which need
not have the \TT{mem} qualifier).  The compare
instruction reads the value at the associated address and compares
it to the value of the {\em compare-variable}.  The instruction
succeeds if the values are equal, and fails otherwise.


\hspace*{-0.2in}{\em \bf Write-Instructions}.
These do what they normally do, except they are all dry-run 
before any actually execute.  During the dry-run one of these
instruction fails if any memory reference it makes would fail
were the instruction actually executed.  In particular, if any
piece of memory is paged out or not in RAM, the dry-run fails.
\end{indpar}

The `\TT{result}' value returned by the {\em atomic-memory-statement}
equals \TT{0} if the statement succeeds, or is the number of the
first failed instruction in the statement block if the statement
fails.

Interrupts are disabled during the execution of an
{\em atomic-memory-statement} so the statement will execute as
fast as the underlying hardware will allow.

\section{Stack Management}
\label{STACK-MANAGEMENT}

Each execution thread has a stack that is not in any other
stack.  Each out-of-line function
execution is a block execution that has a stack which is
by default a substack of the thread in which the function
execution is running.  Each subblock in turn has a stack
which is by default a substack of the stack of its containing block.
And each global area has a stack that is not in any other stack.

Conceptually, the assignment statements in a block each allocate memory for
their variable to the current block stack and copy values to these
variables.  As noted above (Section~\itemref{ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS}),
the memory and associated copies may be
optimized away in some cases.

Stacks are either free or bound.\label{FREE-STACK}
A bound stack is a substack that is
not deallocated from memory until its smallest containing free stack is
deallocated.  The main reason this is important is that stack addresses
can be passed out of a block with a bound stack to its containing block,
but cannot be passed out of a block with a free stack to its containing
or calling block.  This is implemented by giving certain
variables the `\TT{stack}' qualifier: see
Section~\itemref{THE-STACK-QUALIFIER}.

Stacks of out-of-line function executions
(\pagref{OUT-OF-LINE-FUNCTIONS}),
out-of-line assignment statement blocks
(\pagref{OUT-OF-LINE-ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS}),
and
compile-time assignment statement blocks
(\pagref{COMPILE-TIME-ASSIGNMENT-STATEMENTS})
are free, and variables in the {\em result-variable-list}
of a {\em call-assignment-statement},
{\em out-of-line-assignment-statement}, or
{\em compile-time-assignment-statement},
may \underline{not} have the `\TT{stack}' qualifier.

Stacks of loop subblocks are free,
which is implemented by not
allowing the variables in the {\em result-variable-list}
and the iteration variables
of a {\em loop-assignment-statement} to have the `\TT{stack}'
qualifier.

Global area stacks (see Section~\itemref{GLOBAL-AREAS}) are free,
but are never deallocated and make no use of the `\TT{stack}'
qualifier.

All other stacks are bound.  Memory allocated to them
by the `\TT{allocate to stack}' function (\pagref{ALLOCATE-TO-STACK})
is actually
allocated to their smallest containing free stack, and not deallocated
until that free stack is deallocated.

Free stacks are relocatable and can be moved.
Substacks cannot move independently,
but move whenever their smallest containing free stack moves.
Any stack address is relative to its containing free stack,
which is the current free stack at the time executable code uses
the stack address.  To accommodate this builtin memory read-write
functions will not only accept an \TT{adr} value as a RAM address,
but also accept a RAM address consisting of an \TT{unsadr}
offset within the stack and a stack base address that is itself
stored in RAM.  See Section~\itemref{THE-MEM-QUALIFIER} for details.

There are a couple of situations in which free stacks move.

Memory of runtime determined size can be allocated to the end of
a stack by the `\TT{allocate to stack}' and `\TT{allocate to global}'
functions described below, and such may
require that the smallest containing free stack
be moved to a memory region where there is more free memory available.

In a program being debugged, free stacks may be saved after they are no
longer needed by the program, in order to permit them to be analyzed
by a debbugger if the program detects an error.  In this situation
free stacks are allocated to a very big circular buffer, and overwritten
after they are no longer needed by the program.  It may happen that
a free stack whose block is still running is in the way of allocating
a new stack to the circular buffer, in which case the still running
block's free stack may be moved.

Lastly, global area stacks (\pagref{GLOBAL-AREAS})
may be deallocated when programs that
can reference them are still running, or may not yet be allocated
when these programs run.  Deallocated global area stacks are treated as if
they were allocated to inaccessible memory, so deallocating these stacks
is like moving them to inaccessible memory, and referencing
them when they are deallocated gives a memory fault.


\subsection{Unwind Blocks}
\label{UNWIND-BLOCKS}

\ikey{Unwind blocks}{unwind block} are executed only when their
containing block terminates:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{unwind-block}
    ::= \begin{tabular}[t]{l}
	\ttkey{*UNWIND*}\TT{:} \\
	\TT{~~~~}{\em statement}\STAR{} \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

Specifically, when an unwind block is encountered while
executing its containing block, the unwind block is marked
as enabled, but is skipped.  Then when the containing block
terminates, all its enabled unwind blocks are executed in
the reverse order of that in which they were enabled.

Unwind blocks are used to close or deallocate things that were opened.
For example, right after a statement that opens a file there may be
an unwind block that closes the file.  This ensures that the file
will be closed even if the block that opened it terminates later
prematurely with an error, such as a memory fault.

\subsection{Throw and Catch}
\label{THROW-AND-CATCH}

\TT{*THROW*} and \TT{*CATCH*} statements are used to implement
exceptions, i.e., abnormal termination.

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{throw-statement} ::= \TT{*THROW*} \\[1ex]
\emkey{catch-statement} ::= \TT{*CATCH*}
\end{indpar}

The \TT{*THROW*} statement causes its containing block to
\ikey{terminate abnormally}{abnormal termination}.
When a block terminates abnormally, its containing
block is also terminated abnormally.

\ikey{Normal termination}{normal termination}
of a block occurs at the end of the block if
the block has not executed a \TT{*THROW*} or an abnormally
terminating subblock.

Any enabled \TT{*UNWIND*} subblocks of an abnormally terminating
block are executed in reverse order, just as they would be if
the block were terminating normally.  No other part of the block
is executed.

If an \TT{*UNWIND*} subblock executing in an abnormally terminating
containing block \TT{B}
executes a \TT{*CATCH*} statement, the termination of this
containing block \TT{B}
is changed from abnormal to normal.  This means
that \TT{B}'s containing block \TT{C} will resume when the now
normally terminating block \TT{B} finishes terminating.
However, \TT{B} will not execute anything but \TT{*UNWIND*}
subblocks, as it is still terminating.

Machine errors, i.e. memory segment faults, invoke callable functions
which can record error information and execute a \TT{*THROW*}.
Similarly detected programming or data errors can record
error information and execute a \TT{*THROW*}.  An \TT{*UNWIND*}
block can look at recorded error information and decide whether
or not to execute a \TT{*CATCH*}.

If a block has variables it must assign then these need not be
assigned if the block terminates abnormally, as they will not
be visible to enabled \TT{*UNWIND*} blocks.  However, if a block
that is terminating abnormally executes a \TT{*CATCH*} statement,
all variables that the block must assign must be given values, even
though part of the block may not have executed.  The compiler
will check this, and will only permit code that complies in a
straight forward manner.

There are two ways to ensure correct code.  The first is to 
set all block result variables either in or before the
\TT{*UNWIND*} block that contains the \TT{*CATCH*} statement.
The second is to use the special variable
\ttkey{*LAST-ENABLED-UNWIND*} inside the \TT{*UNWIND*} block.
This variable is \TT{true} if and only if the \TT{*UNWIND*}
block is the last \TT{*UNWIND*} block enabled in its containing
block, and so if the varible is \TT{true}, any containing
result variables set after the \TT{*UNWIND*} block need to be
set.  The compiler will accept a statement of the form:
\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
if:
    *LAST-ENABLED-UNWIND*:
        result-variable-1 = ...
        result-variable-2 = ...
	. . . . . . . . . . . .
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}
where the result variables set are those set after the \TT{*UNWIND*}
as satisying the requirement that all result variable be set.


\subsection{Stack Memory Allocation}
\label{STACK-MEMORY-ALLOCATION}

The `\ttkey{allocate to stack}' function allocates \TT{N} bytes of
memory to the current free stack and returns its offset within
the stack and the address of the stack base address:

\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
( stack unsadr offset,
  mem adr offset.base,
  *UNCHECKED* adr offset.base.adr  ) =
allocate to stack ( unsadr N )
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}\label{ALLOCATE-TO-STACK}

Here `\TT{offset}' is the offset of the \TT{N} bytes within the
stack, `\TT{offset.base}' is the base address of the stack, and
stack, `\TT{offset.base.adr}' is the address of where this
base address is stored in RAM.  The first and last of these
are fixed but `\TT{offset.base}' may change when the stack is
moved.

The returned values are a cluster: see Section~\itemref{CLUSTERS}.
Also used are the `\TT{stack}' qualifier (see \itemref{THE-STACK-QUALIFIER})
and `\TT{*UNCHECKED*}' qualifier (see \itemref{THE-UNCHECKED-QUALIFIER}).

The memory is freed when the free stack to which it is allocated
is freed.  The memory containing the \TT{offset.base} value is
also freed at this time.  The inherited `\TT{stack}' qualifier is used to
ensure that addresses of these values cannot survive the free stack:
see \itemref{THE-STACK-QUALIFIER}.

The memory allocated is always alligned on an \TT{8} byte boundary.

If you want a different alignment you can use:

\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
( stack unsadr offset,
  mem adr offset.base,
  *UNCHECKED* adr offset.base.adr  ) =
    allocate to stack ( unsadr N, unsadr O, unsadr A )
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

where \TT{A} must be a power of \TT{2} not greater than \TT{64}.
This will align the \TT{O+1}'st
byte of the allocated memory block
at an address which is a multiple of \TT{A}\,.
Free stacks are always allocated on a \TT{64} byte boundary.


\subsection{Global Areas}
\label{GLOBAL-AREAS}

A global area is like the stack frame of a function that has no
arguments or return value, except that after this function executes,
the global area remains allocated and its variables can be referenced
by other code.  The syntax is:
\begin{indpar}
\emkey{global-area-block} ::= \\
\hspace*{3em}\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l}
	{\em global-area-option}\STAR{}
	\TT{global} {\em global-area-name} \TT{:} \\
	\TT{~~~~}{\em statement}\STAR{} \\
	\end{tabular} \\
\emkey{global-area-option} ::= \ttkey{*COMPILE-TIME*}
                           $|$ \ttkey{*COMPILE-TIME-ONLY*}
\end{indpar}

Several such blocks may have the same {\em global-area-name},
as long as no {\em variable-name} appears in more than one of these blocks.

In order to be accessed a global area must be named in an `\TT{extern}'
statement:
\begin{indpar}
\emkey{extern-global-block} ::= \\
\hspace*{3em}\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l}
	\TT{extern} {\em global-area-abbreviation}
	            \TT{is global} {\em global-area-name} \TT{:} \\
	\TT{~~~~}{\em extern-variable-statement}\STAR{} \\
	\end{tabular}
\\[1ex]
\emkey{extern-variable-statement} \\
\hspace*{3em}\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}rl}
    ::= & {\em qualifier-name}\STAR{} {\em type-name} {\em variable-name} \\
    $|$ & {\em variable-abbreviation} \TT{is}
          {\em qualifier-name}\STAR{} {\em type-name} {\em variable-name} \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

A variable with {\em variable-name}
\TT{V} in a global area with {\em global-area-abbreviation}
\TT{A} may be named as \TT{A.V}, or if the variable has its own
{\em variable-abbreviation} \TT{VA},
this by itself (and \underline{not} \TT{A.VA})
may be used to name the variable.  An abbreviation is only affective
following the `\TT{extern}' statement that defines it within
the same source code file as this `\TT{extern}' statement.

A variable in an
{\em extern-variable-statement} must match its corresponding
{\em global-area-block} variable with respect to type and qualifiers
in the same manner as a function prototype argument variable
matches a function call variable.

If \TT{A.V} is not defined, it is not a compile or link time error
(though there may be warning messages if requested), but accessing
\TT{A.V} will cause a runtime error (typically a segmentation fault).

Memory within a global area can be allocated by:

\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
( global unsadr offset,
  mem adr offset.base,
  *UNCHECKED* adr offset.base.adr  ) =
    allocate to global ( unsadr N )
( global unsadr offset,
  mem adr offset.base,
  *UNCHECKED* adr offset.base.adr  ) =
    allocate to global ( unsadr N, unsadr O, unsadr A )
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}\label{ALLOCATE-TO-GLOBAL}

Here \TT{A} must a power of \TT{2} not greater than \TT{64}.
Global areas are allocated on a \TT{64} byte boundary and
may be moved during execution.

The `\TT{allocate to global}' function plays the same role for
global areas as the `\TT{allocate to stack}' function does for
stacks, accept that the address gets the \TT{global} qualifier
instead of the \TT{stack} qualifier.  The \TT{global} qualifier
is a protected qualifier with \underline{none} of the special `\TT{stack}'
qualifier properties, and normally has no effect on code.

Global areas are run time by default.
The code of a run time
global area block is executed when the file containing it is
loaded, and the stack of the area is allocated and defined at that
time.  Global areas may be deallocated or moved during execution.
References to a global area
that is not yet allocated or that has been deallocated cause runtime
errors (typically segmentation faults).

Global areas may also be made compile time, or both compile and run time,
by use of the \TT{*COM\-PILE-\EOL TIME-\EOL ONLY*} or \TT{*COMPILE-\EOL TIME*}
{\em global-\EOL area-\EOL options} above.  For a compile time
global area, global area blocks are executed in the compiler immediately
after the block compiles, and the global area stack exists in the compiler.
If the global area is also run time, its
block code will be re-executed in the run time enviroment when the
file containing it is linked, and might produce a different stack contents
for the area than the compile time version of the area.

\section{Function Prototypes and Calls}
\label{FUNCTION-PROTOTYPES-AND-CALLS}

In this section we elaborate on the {\em function-prototypes} that were
introduced in Section~\itemref{FUNCTIONS}.   Here we replace
\begin{center}
{\em function-name} {\em argument-variable-list}\QMARK{}
\end{center}
by `{\em function-pattern}'.  We also add to the set of possible
{\em qualifying-expressions}.

The extended syntax is:

\begin{indpar}
\emkey{function-declaration}
    ::= \begin{tabular}[t]{l}
        {\em function-prototype}\TT{:} \\
	~~~~ {\em statement}\STAR{} \\

\\[1ex]

\\[1ex]
\emkey{function-pattern}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}rl}

Matching a function call to a {\em function-pattern} begins as follows.
The {\em function-pattern} is changed to by omitting some
{\em function-terms}, replicating others, and reordering the resulting
list of {\em function-terms}.
However, the first {\em function-term}
in the {\em function-pattern} is never deleted or moved in the ordering.

Any {\em pattern-name} that has
{\em alternative-names} specified by a {\em qualifying-expression}
are replaced by one of its {\em alternative-names}.
If any {\em function-term} has the form
\begin{center}
{\em pattern-name} \TT{( bool } {\em variable-name} \TT{) ?}
\end{center}
the term may be replaced by either
`{\em pattern-name}' or `\TT{no} {\em pattern-name}', in which
cases the variable will be assigned the values \TT{true} or \TT{false}
respectively.

Then the `\TT{|}'s and {\em function-term-modifiers} are deleted.
The result is called the `\key{unfolded}' pattern.

At this point the function call and the unfolded pattern must match,
in that
{\em pattern-names} must match exactly, any `\TT{no}' introduced
in the unfolded pattern must match exactly,
and
{\em opening/\EOL closing-argument-brackets} must match exactly,
while the remaining parts of {\em argu\-ment-variable-lists}
must match as described below.

To make the unfolded pattern unique,
no two {\em pattern-names} in a {\em function-pattern} may be the same,
and no two {\em opening-argument-brackets} that \underline{begin}
some {\em function-term} may be the same.

The {\em function-term-modifiers} determine whether a {\em function-term}
may be replicated or deleted.  If \TT{?} is in the modifier, the term
may be deleted.  If \TT{...} is in the modifier, the term may be replicated.
The first {\em function-term} may \underline{not} have a modifier containing
\TT{?}.

Within the body of a function, the {\em pattern-names} become
distinct constants of type `\ttkey{pattern name}'.  These are used in
the following builtin functions:

\begin{indpar}[0.5in]

\hspace*{-0.3in}{\tt (unsadr size) = \ttmkey{count}{of {\tt pattern name}}
			( pattern name N )} \\
Number of repetitions of the {\em function-term} containing the
pattern name in the unfolded pattern.  \TT{0} if the {\em function-term}
was deleted.

\end{indpar}

\section{Memory Channels}
\label{MEMORY-CHANNELS}

OLD STUFF: REVISE.

A \key{memory channel} is a mechanism for accessing a set of blocks in RAM
that permits blocks to be announced substantially in advance of being
accessed.  Thus memory channels implement `\key{look ahead}' for
memory accesses.

A memory channel implements a \key{window}, which is a
structured set of elements each associated with a member of
some data set.  Each window element contains a
\key{block descriptor} that holds the address and length of the
memory block that contains the data associated with the element.
Block descriptors can also be marked as
\mkey{empty}{block descriptor}, meaning there is no block to be accessed.
The window has a \key{reference point}, and window elements are addressed
relative to this reference point.  There are shift operations that move
the reference point to a nearby window element.

Although we talk about blocks here, a block can be just a numeric array
element, and can be as small as a single bit.  Although we talk about
each element of a memory channel window having its own block descriptor,
an actual memory channel may use only block group descriptors, each of
which functions as a group of more than one individual element
block descriptor.

A memory channel is stored in a cluster.  As such it is mostly an
inline construction, though it can be passed to or returned from a
function, and the function can be all or partly out-of-line.

The most common type of memory channel has a window that appears to be
an array with \ttikey{.di\-men\-sions}{dimensions!of memory channel},
\ttdmkey{lower\_bound}{of memory channel}\TT{[}$i$\TT{]},
and \ttdmkey{upper\_bound}{of memory channel}\TT{[}$i$\TT{]}
being memory channel members.  Such are called
\key{array windows}.
If the memory channel cluster name is $M$, the window elements are
referred to by $M$\TT{[}$i_0$\TT{,}$i_1$\TT{,}\ldots\TT{]},
with $M$\TT{[0,0,}\ldots\TT{]} being the \key{reference point}.

The reference point can be shifted along any of the window's
dimensions by the command
\begin{center}
$M$\ttdkey{center}\TT{[}$i_0$\TT{,}$i_1$\TT{,}\ldots\TT{]}
\end{center}
This shifts
the window so that what was
$M$\TT{[}$i_0$\TT{,}$i_1$\TT{,}\ldots\TT{]} becomes
$M$\TT{[0,0,}\ldots\TT{]}.

Creating memory channels and completely reseting their reference points
are specific to the type of memory channel, and are not covered in
this section.

For most kinds of memory channels, block descriptors are computed
automatically when channel is created, when the window is
shifted, or when the data of
a neighboring window element is arrives from memory.
Immediately after a block descriptor is created, a read-ahead of
the block is initiated.  This read-ahead overlaps computation that
does not use the block contents.

If a memory channel accesses arrays stored in memory,
the channel block descriptors can be computed from the array coordinates
of the reference point.  Other memory channels use the contents
of a block to compute the block descriptors of neighboring blocks
in the window.

An example of the latter is a binary tree memory channel.
Let $M$ be such a channel, and let `\TT{.L}' denote the left
child of a binary tree element, `\TT{.R}' the right child, and
`\TT{.P}' the parent.  Then $M\!$\TT{.L.R} denotes the right
child of the left child of the reference point, $M\!$\TT{.P.L}
denotes the left child of the parent of the reference point,
and $M\!$\TT{.P.L.center} moves the reference point to this last element.
The window of such a memory channel might contain the depth 2
subtree of the reference point plus that closest 4 ancestors of the
reference point if these have been visited.  When the reference
point is moved, as soon as the reference point element has been
read from memory, the descriptors for its children are built and
the read of the children is initiated in parallel with other
computation.  When the children arrive from memory, the descriptors
of their children are built and reads of the data pointed at
are initiated.\footnote{All this can actually be done with modern
hardware: code is executed to read the reference point children and initiate the
reads of their children, and a modern processor will automatically
save the code that
executes when a read of a reference point child completes and execute
other code in parallel until the read does complete.}

Some standard memory channel types are built into the L-Language.
Others can be defined by users.

\section{Aliasing Hardware}
\label{ALIASING-HARDWARE}

The ultimate solution to the aliasing problem is new hardware.
At its simplest, registers, which currently hold a datum,
are replaced by triples of registers which hold a datum,
an address, and selection codes.  The register datum equals the value
of the memory location at the register address.  The selection
codes determine which part of this memory location is read or written
when the register is read or written.  If any memory location is
changed, the address of the location is checked against all the
register addresses, and if any match, the corresponding register
data are changed.

This is, however, not sufficient, because sometimes one register
address is a function of another register's datum.  For example,
consider the unchecked code:
\begin{indpar}[0.5em]\begin{verbatim}
struct S { ...; int32 m; ... }
S * * x
S * *& y = * x
int32 *& z = y->m
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}
If we consider \TT{x}, \TT{y}, and \TT{z} to be registers,
the address of \TT{y} equals the value of \TT{x}, and the
address of \TT{z} equals the value of \TT{y} plus the offset of
\TT{m} in \TT{S}.

If the value of \TT{x} changes, this changes the address of \TT{y},
which may change the datum of \TT{y} and that may change the value
of \TT{y}.  If the value of \TT{y} changes, this changes the address
of \TT{z}, which may change the datum and value of \TT{z}.

The way we accommodate this is to use the selection codes of \TT{y}
to specify that the address of \TT{y} contains the value of \TT{x}
as an additive component, so
that if the value of \TT{x} is changed by adding $\Delta$\TT{x}
then the address of \TT{y} should be changed by adding $\Delta$\TT{x}.
And similarly the selection codes
of \TT{z} specify that the address of \TT{z}
contains the value of \TT{y} as an additive component.

So why should we bother with automatically updating
additive inclusions of one value in the
address of another value, and not bother with other expressions.
The reason is that expressions such as
`\TT{(*x)->m}' are likely to be reused frequently in code (actually,
in automatically generated code) and
therefore need to be cached, whereas an expressions of the form
`\TT{c*d}' will be reused comparatively rarely code
and therefore are not worth special hardware.
