This is a line;
This is a line containing a "quoted string".
This is a line containing a large number
     12345678901234567890.
This is a line containing a parenthesized subexpression
     ( hi there ).
This line contains subsubexpressions (x 5 "foo")
This line contains more subsubexpressions
     (x + `y z {{p q}}' - [ g h ]).
This line contains a missing closing bracket
     (x + {{ y z )
This line contains an incorrect closing bracket
     (x + y }}
This line includes
 a token with insufficient indent
This line starts an indented paragraph:
   First line.
   Second line.
Ditto with split =:
   Third line.
   Fourth line.
Ditto with separator:
   Fifth line.
   Sixth line A; Sixth line B
   Seventh line.
This tests selector changes --- <+ x +> <- y ->
     {{ <+ x +> <- y ->}} `<+ x +> <- y ->'
This is a label [< x y "hello" 5.6 z >]
This is another label [< x ( y ) z >]
And these are nested labels [< x [< 1 2 >] y [< a b >] >]
This line contains a typed subexpression {x|1 2 3|}
Another typed subexpression
    {x: w, y = 6, z = b c 5 d|1 2 3|}
Yet another typed subexpression
    {x: w, z = b c 5 d|1 2 3|y = 6 : x}
And another- {| x y z |b[ABC_,200] = (1 2 3),
                       no c[+], d[-], no f, g : t}
And one more {| |b["A", 201,202, [5]]: t}
A prefix expression ({W} 2 3 {X} 4 5 ({Y} 6 7) {Z})
{X} a b c {X}{Y} d e {Y} f g {X} h k
{X} a b c; {X}{Y} f g; {X} h k
{- a b c -}
{< a b c >}
{- a b c}
